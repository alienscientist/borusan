# Multi-Document LLM Agent for Tesla Technical Documentation
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a multi-document Large Language Model (LLM) agent, specifically tailored to handle technical documentation of Tesla models. 
The goal is to provide a sophisticated tool for parsing, summarizing, and comparing intricate technical details across various Tesla models.

## Implementation Details
- Document Agents and Top Agent: The architecture for building document-specific agents and a coordinating top agent is adapted from [this project](https://github.com/run-llama/create_llama_projects/blob/main/multi-document-agent/README.md).
- Composable Graph Engine: The implementation of a composable graph engine, which enables comparative analysis of different models, is based on methodologies outlined in [LLAMA Index Documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/putting_it_all_together/q_and_a/unified_query.html).

## Future Directions
Data-Driven Performance Enhancement
The performance and capability of the top agent are directly proportional to the quality and diversity of the input data. 
By injecting more varied and well-structured data into the LLM model, we can significantly enhance the quality of the responses.

### Expansion and Diversification
- Cross-Brand Technical Documentation: An exciting extension could be the inclusion of technical documentation from various automotive brands, aiding customers in discerning the best brand for their needs.
- Sales Data Integration: Incorporating detailed sales data, including different brand sales and other customers preferences, will allow the agent to assist customers in finding their ideal car model based on specific preferences.

### Efficiency Optimization
- Document Summarization: In case of performance issues, employing a document summary agent to condense texts can be effective. This approach reduces the computational load and response time, as the final agents process these summarized texts instead of raw data.
