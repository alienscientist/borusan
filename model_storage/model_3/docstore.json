To minimize driver distraction and \nensure the safety of vehicle occupants as well as other road users, avoid using the touchscreen to adjust \nsettings while the vehicle is in motion.\nUse the touchscreen to control many features that, in traditional cars, are controlled using physical buttons (for \nexample, adjusting the cabin heating and air conditioning, headlights, etc.). You also use the touchscreen to control \nmedia, navigate, use entertainment features, and customize Model 3  to suit your preferences. For hands-free access \nto common touchscreen controls, use voice commands (see Voice Commands  on page 14 ).\nIf the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, you can restart it (see Restarting the \nTouchscreen  on page 7 ).\nNOTE:  Illustrations are provided to improve conceptual understanding only. Depending on vehicle options, software \nversion, market region and regional and language settings, the details displayed on the screen will differ .\n1.

Navigation : Change the orientation of the map, find or navigate to a destination, and change navigation settings \n(see Maps and Navigation  on page 148 ).\n3. Car status : This area dynamically displays the current status of Model 3  as you drive, park, open doors, turn lights \non, etc. Monitor this area when driving as it displays important information such as driving speed and warning \nmessages (see Car Status  on page 11 ). When the car is in Park, you can open the trunks or charge port door. This \narea also houses shortcut \"cards\" for Media, tire pressures, and Trip Information.\nWhen full self-driving is enabled (if equipped), the car status area displays visualizations of the road and your \nvehicle's surroundings. You can expand/condense the visualization by dragging the car status area from side to \nside. Expanding the visualization displays more details about the roadway and its surroundings, including road \nmarkings, stop lights, and objects (such as trash cans and poles).Touchscreen\n5 Overview", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "568fe40c-d590-432f-8166-71c806c39ca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "568fe40c-d590-432f-8166-71c806c39ca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dcc5a771-cf90-4c97-bf36-8195c7b6f4b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "afad8917b1786c03f0cfbe1a4ae0d35c61c18e700eb5d7b768c040af14142ab3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfe139db-3696-460c-97d2-ccc5d4b72af9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "c6eb8c32cd21822bb65b5c763081af147c3c352007dd23632260d41987995402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9466f713-bdd9-48ab-9c40-5efe98973b22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f09253670c514b974e4af3eb3d4413f53c3f08e435699612595d330d01cd0f83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8fa17b38637af912034fa3b8d723510b11296347751e2c76cfd58f3e90c80b44", "text": "4.

Doing so \nincreases security and minimizes power consumption.\nThe USB ports can output power up to approximately \n15W (which may vary depending on vehicle manufacture \ndate).\nNOTE:  For some vehicles manufactured after \napproximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB \nports may only support charging devices. Use the USB \nport inside the glove box for all other functions.\nBoth ports are USB-C compatible.\nSee USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos  on \npage 137  for information about formatting USB flash \ndrives.\nOpen the front compartment of the center console. The \nfront USB ports are located on the rear wall of the \ncompartment.\nDepending on date of manufacture, some vehicles \ninclude a USB port located inside the glovebox. This \nUSB-A port is equipped with a pre-formatted flash  drive , \nready to save videos when using features such as Sentry \nMode and Dashcam . Although not its primary purpose, \nthis port can also communicate with the vehicle and can \nbe used to charge a USB-connected device.\nTwo additional USB ports are located in the rear of the \ncenter console (on vehicles manufactured since \napproximately June 2020, these ports are USB-C). These \nports charge USB-connected devices but do not \ncommunicate with the vehicle.\nNOTE:  Power is available whenever the vehicle is \nconsidered \"awake\". The vehicle may be awake for many \nreasons. For example, when using features such as \nSummon, or when features such as Preconditioning, \nKeep Climate On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, Sentry Mode, \netc. are enabled.

A camera is mounted above the rear license plate.\n2. Ultrasonic sensors are located in the front and rear \nbumpers.\n3. A camera is mounted in each door pillar.\n4. Three cameras are mounted to the windshield above \nthe rear view mirror.\n5. A camera is mounted to each front fender.\n6. Radar  (if equipped)  is mounted behind the front \nbumper.\nModel 3  is also equipped with high precision \nelectronically-assisted braking and steering systems.\nCabin Camera\nYour Model 3  may be equipped with a cabin camera \nlocated above the rear view mirror. For more \ninformation, see Cabin Camera  on page 130 .\nDrive to Calibrate Cameras\nModel 3  must maneuver with precision when Autopilot \nfeatures are being used. Therefore, before some features \ncan be used for the first time or after some types of \nservice repairs, cameras must complete a self-calibration \nprocess. For your convenience, the touchscreen  displays \na progress indicator.\nWhen calibration is complete, Autopilot features are \navailable for use. Calibration typically completes after \ndriving 20-25 miles (32-40 km) , but the distance varies \ndepending on road and environmental conditions. For \nexample, calibration completes quicker when driving on \na straight road with multiple lanes (such as a controlled-\naccess highway), with highly-visible lane markings (in \nthe driving lane as well as the adjacent lanes). Contact \nTesla only if your Model 3  has not completed the \ncalibration process after driving 100 miles (160 km)  in \nthe described conditions.\nIf a camera has shifted from its calibrated position (for \nexample, the camera or windshield was replaced), you \nmust clear the calibration. To do so, touch Controls  > \nService  > Camera Calibration > Clear Calibration . When \nthe calibration is cleared, Model 3  repeats the calibration \nprocess. While this helps re-calibrate the cameras in \nmany cases, Clear Calibration  may not resolve all \ncamera and sensor concerns.\nNOTE:  To calibrate, cameras require highly-visible lane \nmarkings in both the driving lane and adjacent lanes (at \nleast two lanes over on each side of the vehicle). For \nbest results, drive in the middle lane of a multi-lane \nhighway (ideally with at least five lanes) that has clear \nlane markings and minimal traffic.\nNOTE:  If you attempt to use a feature that is not \navailable until the calibration process is complete, the \nfeature is disabled and the touchscreen  displays a \nmessage.\nNOTE:  Model 3  must repeat the calibration process if the \ncameras are serviced by Tesla, and in some cases, after a \nsoftware update.\nKeeping Cameras Free of \nObstructions\nTo ensure the various Autopilot components can provide \ninformation that is as accurate as possible, keep cameras \nand sensors (if equipped) clean and free of obstructions, \ncondensation, or damage (see Cleaning  on page 183 ).\nCondensation can form inside the camera enclosures, \nespecially if you park your vehicle outside in cold or wet \nconditions. The touchscreen  may display an alert stating \nthat a camera is blocked and that some or all Autopilot \nfeatures may be temporarily restricted until the camera \nvision is clear. To proactively dry the condensation, \nprecondition the cabin by setting it to a warm Cameras\n16 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e0c674e-6cc1-4112-b43a-12f5b514a95c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e0c674e-6cc1-4112-b43a-12f5b514a95c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42cb0e2a-0d43-481a-81c3-7bc644ac39d6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "29839d972ec90c8c85497633d689c65c9d27d79f1add5f6a68d8cfb9e3fe6320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "96f4aaaf-1efa-4f87-8b68-43790c3b2b02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "aaae9dc518d19697e4b30416d3169369a5317359471b95602c272aa4504c657c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a68bbf9-25e0-4422-9383-89b3e5a5ef0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "7befcfb76dc3f8c160fed3ff18df5225ce3c4cb2311d76a1fee2f00520304ca9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "999c29d582f783b2a0d3638c4c6e13348ebe5fe7b254bf2edaf66a4a97944d07", "text": "temperature, turning the windshield defroster on, and \ndirecting the front air vents toward the door pillars (see \nMobile App  on page 50 ).Cameras\n17 Overview", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a68bbf9-25e0-4422-9383-89b3e5a5ef0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a68bbf9-25e0-4422-9383-89b3e5a5ef0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ddc0d41-1162-467a-9c18-f25a637bd182", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "feca337092cc6cbbd9b414fd1ec1616c2d8e12d9af1235167041978e43b407d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e0c674e-6cc1-4112-b43a-12f5b514a95c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "999c29d582f783b2a0d3638c4c6e13348ebe5fe7b254bf2edaf66a4a97944d07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aec87477-aca1-479c-814c-8b31789bc2df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "8ec79f9a003a48402772cd4fac7155ea5de5e1a876be57ecb7fa6335da2588fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7befcfb76dc3f8c160fed3ff18df5225ce3c4cb2311d76a1fee2f00520304ca9", "text": "Types of Keys\nModel 3  supports the following types of keys:\n\u2022 Phone key  - You can set up your personal phone as a \n\"phone key\" that communicates with Model 3  using \nBluetooth. A phone key supports automatic locking \nand unlocking.\n\u2022 Key card  - Tesla provides a key card that \ncommunicates with Model 3  using short range radio-\nfrequency identification  (RFID) signals. The key card \nis used to \"authenticate\" phone keys to work with \nModel 3  and to add or remove other keys. Unlike the \nphone key  and key fobs , the key card does not \nsupport automatic locking and unlocking. In \nsituations where your phone key has a dead battery, \nor is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, drive, \nand lock Model 3 .\n\u2022 Key fob  - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to \npress buttons to open the front and rear trunks, and \nunlock, lock, and drive Model 3 . The key fob also \nsupports automatic locking and unlocking, if available \nin your region (see Walk-Away Door Lock  on page \n23) and can be used as a backup to your phone key.\nModel 3  supports a total of 19 keys, which can include \nphone keys , key cards, and up to four key fobs.\nCAUTION:  Remember to bring a key with you \nwhen you drive. Although you can drive Model 3 \naway from its key, you will be unable to power it \nback on after it powers off.\nPhone Key\nUsing your phone as a key is a convenient way to access \nyour Model 3 . As you approach, your phone's Bluetooth \nsignal is detected and the doors unlock  when you pull a \ndoor handle . Likewise, when you exit and walk away with \nthe phone key, doors automatically lock (provided the \nWalk-Away Door Lock  feature is turned on; see Walk-\nAway Door Lock  on page 23 ).\nBefore you can use a phone to access Model 3 , follow \nthese steps to authenticate it:\n1. Download the Tesla mobile app to your phone.\n2. Log into the Tesla mobile app using your Tesla \naccount username and password.\nNOTE:  You must remain logged in to your Tesla \naccount to use your phone to access Model 3 .\nNOTE:  If multiple vehicles are linked to your Tesla \naccount, you must ensure that the vehicle you want \nthe mobile app to access is currently selected on the \nmobile app.\n3. Ensure:\n\u25e6 Your phone's general Bluetooth settings are \nenabled.\u25e6 Bluetooth is enabled within your phone's settings \nfor the Tesla mobile app. For example, on your \nphone, navigate to Settings, choose the Tesla \nmobile app, and ensure the Bluetooth setting is \nturned on.\n\u25e6 Access to your location is enabled. Open the Tesla \nmobile app in your phone's settings and select \nLocation  > Always . For the best experience, keep \nthe mobile app running in the background.\n\u25e6 Allow Mobile Access is enabled on the vehicle \ntouchscreen ( Controls  > Safety > Allow Mobile \nAccess ).\nNOTE:  Model 3  communicates with your phone using \nBluetooth. Keep in mind that your phone must have \nenough battery power to run Bluetooth and that \nmany phones disable Bluetooth when the battery is \nlow.\n4. While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla \nmobile app and touch Set Up Phone Key  on the main \nscreen, or navigate to Security  > Set Up Phone Key . \nFollow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle \ntouchscreen to set up your phone key.\nTo view a list of keys that can currently access Model 3 , \nor to remove a phone key, touch Controls  > Locks  (see \nManaging Keys  on page 21 ).\nModel 3  can connect to three phone keys \nsimultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys \nare detected and you want to authenticate or pair a \ndifferent  phone, move the other connected phone key(s) \nout of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting.\nOnce a phone has been authenticated, it no longer \nrequires an internet connection to be used as a phone \nkey for Model 3 . However, to use the phone hands-free, \naccess your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., \nyou must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth \ndevice (see Bluetooth  on page 53 ).\nSome smartphones with NFC capability can be used to \nlock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. \nEnsure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your \nvehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aec87477-aca1-479c-814c-8b31789bc2df": {"__data__": {"id_": "aec87477-aca1-479c-814c-8b31789bc2df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ddc0d41-1162-467a-9c18-f25a637bd182", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "feca337092cc6cbbd9b414fd1ec1616c2d8e12d9af1235167041978e43b407d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a68bbf9-25e0-4422-9383-89b3e5a5ef0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "7befcfb76dc3f8c160fed3ff18df5225ce3c4cb2311d76a1fee2f00520304ca9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a21a5388-0ebb-4ebe-99af-ee5a8665e516", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "9d829fbe0177b3f8cec4643b70cba60bc94a2bb9c0ef4a70f01136719bfb7d52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8ec79f9a003a48402772cd4fac7155ea5de5e1a876be57ecb7fa6335da2588fc", "text": "Model 3  can connect to three phone keys \nsimultaneously.

Key fobs with the MODEL 3 logo printed on the \nflat side cannot passively lock and unlock Model 3 .\nLocking and unlocking Model 3  with your key fob is \nconveniently hands-free. Although you must be carrying \na paired key fob, there is no need to use it. Model 3  has \nsensors around the vehicle that can recognize the \npresence of a key fob within a range of approximately \nsix feet (two meters) . Therefore, you can keep your key \nfob in your pocket or purse and simply pull on the door \nhandle to unlock. When carrying your key fob with you, \nyou can also open the trunk without having to use the \nkey by pressing the rear trunk 's exterior door handle. If \nWalk-Away Door Lock  is enabled, Model 3  automatically \nlocks when you exit and the key fob is no longer in range \n(see Walk-Away Door Lock  on page 23 ). Passive locking \nand unlocking is automatically enabled when you pair \nyour key fob to Model 3 .\nAlthough you can use the same key fob with multiple \nvehicles, it can only be paired to one vehicle at a time. \nTo activate a paired key fob to a different  vehicle, touch \nthe flat side onto the driver's side door pillar and click \nany button on the key fob to confirm.NOTE:  For increased security, passive locking and \nunlocking disables after being stationary for five minutes \nwhile within vehicle range when the vehicle is not in use \n(for example, you are standing outside your vehicle). In \nthis situation, you must shake or press a button on the \nkey fob to re-enable passive locking and unlocking.\nReplacing the Key Fob Battery\nUnder normal use, the accessory key fob has a battery \nthat lasts for up to one year, depending on key fob \nversion and selected vehicle settings. When the battery \nis low, a message displays on the touchscreen.\nTo replace the key fob battery:\n1. With the key fob placed button side down on a soft \nsurface, release the bottom cover, using a small flat-\nbladed  tool.\n2.

If all \noccupants are buckled up and the \nreminder stays on, re-buckle seat belts to \nensure they are correctly latched. Also \nremove any heavy objects (such as a \nbriefcase) from an unoccupied seat. If the \nreminder light continues to stay on, \ncontact Tesla.\nYou can temporarily disable a seat belt reminder \nassociated with a rear seating position.

To disable the \nreminder, touch the associated seat on the seat belt \nreminder popup message that displays on the \ntouchscreen when a seat belt reminder is active. When a \nreminder is disabled, the seat belt reminder icon is \nreplaced by a seat icon, for the current drive only. Touch \nthe seat again to re-enable the reminder.\nWARNING:  Seat belts must be worn by passengers \nin all seating positions. Do not disable a seat belt \nreminder when the seating position is occupied by \na passenger.\nTo Fasten a Belt\n1. Ensure correct positioning of the seat. See (see \nCorrect Driving Position  on page 31 ) for details on the \ncorrect position of the driver's seat.2. Draw the belt out smoothly, ensuring the belt lays flat \nacross the pelvis, chest and mid-point of your collar \nbone, between the neck and shoulder. Ensure the belt \nis routed correctly and is not twisted.

The seat belt should lay flat across \nthe mid-point of your collar bone while in the correct \ndriving position  (see Correct Driving Position  on page \n31). Adjust the height of the shoulder anchor if the seat \nbelt is not positioned correctly:\n1. Press and hold the button on the shoulder anchor to \nrelease the locking mechanism.\n2.

Check that unreeling is free from snags, and \nvisually check the webbing for wear. Allow the \nwebbing to retract, checking that retraction is \nsmooth and complete.\n4. With the webbing half unreeled, hold the tongue \nplate and pull forward quickly. The mechanism should \nlock automatically and prevent further unreeling.\nIf a seat belt fails any of these tests, repair immediately. \nDo not allow occupants to sit in a seat with a failed seat \nbelt.\nFor information about cleaning seat belts, see Seat Belts \non page 185 .\nSeat Belt Warnings\nWARNING:  Seat belts should be worn by all \noccupants at all times, even if driving for a very \nshort distance. Failure to do so increases the risk \nof injury or death if a collision occurs.\nWARNING:  Secure small children in a suitable child \nsafety seat as described in the Owner's Manual. \nAlways follow the child safety seat manufacturer's \ninstructions when installing.\nWARNING:  Ensure that all seat belts are worn \ncorrectly. An improperly worn seat belt increases \nthe risk of injury or death if a collision occurs.\nWARNING:  Never sit on top of any seat belt \ncomponent. Doing so can cause damage or \nimproper deployment of safety equipment.\nWARNING:  Do not wear seat belts over hard, \nfragile or sharp items in clothing, such as pens, \nkeys, eyeglasses, etc. The pressure from the seat \nbelt on such items can cause injury.\nWARNING:  Seat belts should not be worn with any \npart of the strap twisted.\nWARNING:  Each seat belt assembly must be used \nby one occupant only. It is dangerous to put a seat \nbelt around a child being carried on an occupant\u2019s \nlap.\nWARNING:  Seat belts that have been worn in a \ncollision must be inspected or replaced by Tesla, \neven if damage to the assembly is not obvious.\nWARNING:  Seat belts that show signs of wear, or \nhave been cut or damaged in any way must be \nreplaced immediately.\nWARNING:  Avoid contaminating a seat belt\u2019s \ncomponents with any chemicals, liquids, grit, dirt \nor cleaning products. If a seat belt fails to retract \nor latch into the buckle, it must be replaced \nimmediately. Use the mobile app to schedule a \nservice appointment.\nWARNING:  Do not make modifications  or \nadditions that can prevent a seat belt mechanism \nfrom taking up slack, or that can prevent a seat \nbelt from being adjusted to remove slack. A seat \nbelt with slack greatly reduces occupant \nprotection.\nWARNING:  Do not make modifications  that can \ninterfere with the operation of a seat belt, or that \ncan cause a seat belt to become inoperable.\nWARNING:  Do not use after market comfort and \nconvenience products that attach to the seat belts.\nWARNING:  When seat belts are not in use, they \nshould be fully retracted and not hanging loose.

You must restrain infants and small children in \nthe second row seats only, and you must use a suitable child safety seat appropriate for the child\u2019s age, weight, and \nsize.\nWARNING:  Never seat a child on a seat with an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front of it. DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to \nthe child can occur. See Airbags  on page 44 .\nWARNING:  Do not associate the Easy Entry  setting with the driver's profile  when a child is seated in the \nsecond row. Doing so can cause the driver's seat to push against the child, especially when a child is seated in \na forward-facing child seat or booster seat. Do not rely on Model 3  to recognize or accommodate a child \nseated in the second row while using this setting  (see Driver Profiles  on page 82 ).\nRefer to the following label located on the sun visors.\nNOTE:  The image shown below is representative only and may not be identical to the label(s) in your vehicle.\nModel 3  has an occupancy sensor in the front passenger seat that controls the status of the passenger front airbag \n(see Airbags  on page 44 ).\nWhen driving with a child seat on the front passenger seat, always double-check the status of the \npassenger front airbag to confirm  that it is OFF.\nTo protect an adult subsequently occupying the front passenger seat, check to verify that the \npassenger front airbag is ON.\nWARNING:  It is the driver's responsibility to confirm  that the passenger front airbag is OFF when a child is \nseated in the front passenger seat. If the passenger front airbag fails to disable with a child seat in position, \nplace the child and child restraint system in the rear seat and use the mobile app to schedule service \nimmediately.\nWARNING:  Always ensure that all Model 3  seats are locked in position before traveling. Failure to do so \nincreases the risk of injury.

Do not extend the \nseat belt webbing fully to engage the automatic \nlocking retractor (ALR). \nInstalling Child Safety Seats\nThere are two general methods used to install child \nsafety seats:\n\u2022 Seat belt retained - these seats are secured using the \nvehicle\u2019s seat belts.\n\u2022 LATCH  retained - these seats attach to anchor bars \nbuilt into the vehicle\u2019s rear seats.\nCheck the child safety seat manufacturer\u2019s instructions \nand the table provided in this document to determine \nwhich installation method to use. Some child safety \nseats can be installed using either method. Always \nfollow the child safety seat manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nInstalling Seat Belt Retained Child \nSeats\nFirst, make sure that the child safety seat is appropriate \nfor the weight, height, and age of the child.\nAvoid dressing the child in bulky clothing and do not \nplace any objects between the child and the restraint \nsystem.\nAdjust harnesses for every child, every trip.\nTo securely hold child safety seats, all passenger seating \npositions are equipped with an automatic locking \nretractor (ALR) that, by pulling the seat belt beyond the \nlength needed for a typical adult occupant, locks the \nbelt into place until the seat belt is unbuckled and the \nwebbing is fully retracted. The ALR mechanism operates \nas a ratchet, winding in slack and preventing the seat \nbelt from extending any further until it has been \ncompletely rewound. When installing a child safety seat, \nengage the belt's automatic locking retractor by pulling the seat belt webbing until it is fully extended. The ALR \nsystem engages only when the seat belt is at its \nmaximum extension point.\nThe automatic locking retractor (ALR) feature is not \nused for booster seats in which a large child is restrained \nby the vehicle's seat belts directly, and therefore not \nusing a child safety seat's integrated restraints.\nNOTE:  An automatic locking retractor disengages only \nwhen the seat belt is unbuckled and fully retracted. The \nbelt can then be worn as a normal belt, sliding freely in \nand out and locking tight only in an emergency. Once \ndisengaged, the belt must be fully extended to re-\nengage the locking mechanism whenever you install a \nchild safety seat.\nAlways follow the detailed instructions provided by the \nchild safety seat manufacturer. General guidelines are \nprovided below.\n1. Place the child safety seat in Model 3 , and fully \nextend the seat belt.

Do not seat a child on \nthe front passenger seat even if you are using a \nchild safety seat. This seat has an airbag in front of \nit. Although this airbag is disabled when Model 3 \ndetects a lightweight passenger, do not rely on \ntechnology to protect your child.\nWARNING:  Child restraint systems are designed to \nbe secured in vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap \nbelt portion of a lap-shoulder belt. Children could \nbe endangered in a crash if their child restraints \nare not properly secured in the vehicle.\nWARNING:  According to collision statistics, \nchildren are safer when properly restrained in the \nrear seating positions than in the front seating \npositions.\nWARNING:  Do not use a forward facing child \nsafety seat until your child weighs over 20 lbs (9 \nkg) and can sit independently. Up to the age of \ntwo, a child's spine and neck are not sufficiently \ndeveloped to avoid injury in a frontal impact.\nWARNING:  Do not allow a baby or infant to be \nheld on an adult's lap. All children should be \nrestrained in an appropriate child safety seat at all \ntimes.\nWARNING:  To ensure children are safely seated, \nfollow all instructions provided in this document \nand by the manufacturer of the child safety seat.\nWARNING:  Children should ride in a rear facing \nchild safety seat using the seat\u2019s integrated 5-\npoint harness for as long as possible.\nWARNING:  Do not use seat belt extenders on a \nseat belt that is being used to install a child safety \nseat or booster seat.\nWARNING:  When seating larger children, make \nsure the child's head is supported and the child\u2019s \nseat belt is properly adjusted and fastened. The \nshoulder portion of the belt must be away from \nthe face and neck, and the lap portion must not be \nover the stomach.\nWARNING:  Never attach two child safety seats to \none anchor point. In a collision, one anchor point \nmay be incapable of securing both seats.\nWARNING:  Child restraint anchors are designed to \nwithstand only those loads imposed by correctly \nfitted  child restraints. Under no circumstances are \nthey to be used for adult seat belts, harnesses, or \nfor attaching other items or equipment to the \nvehicle.\nWARNING:  Always check harnesses and tether \nstraps for damage and wear.\nWARNING:  Never leave a child unattended, even if \nthe child is secured in a child safety seat.\nWARNING:  Never use a child safety seat that has \nbeen involved in a collision.

These thresholds are \ndesigned to predict the severity of a crash in time for \nthe airbags to help protect the vehicle's occupants. \nAirbags inflate  instantly with considerable force \naccompanied by a loud noise. The inflated  bag, together \nwith the seat belts, limits movement of occupants to \nreduce the risk of injury.\nFront airbags are not ordinarily designed to inflate  in \nrear collisions, rollovers, side collisions and when braking \nheavily or driving over bumps and potholes. Likewise, \nfront airbags may not inflate  in all frontal collisions, such \nas minor front collisions, underride collisions, or minor \nimpacts with narrow objects (such as posts or poles). \nSignificant  superficial  damage can occur to the vehicle \nwithout the airbags inflating  and, conversely, a relatively \nsmall amount of structural damage can cause airbags to \ninflate.  Therefore, the external appearance of the vehicle \nafter a collision does not represent whether or not the \nfront airbags should have inflated.\nWARNING:  Before modifying your vehicle to \naccommodate a person with disabilities in a way \nthat may affect  the airbag system, contact Tesla.\nTypes of Airbags\nModel 3  has the following types of airbags:\n\u2022 Front airbags: The front airbags are designed to \nreduce injuries if larger children or adults are riding in \nthe front seats. Follow all warnings and instructions \nrelated to seating a child on the front passenger seat \n(if permitted in your market region). See Child Safety \nSeats  on page 38 .\n\u2022 Knee airbags: Knee airbags and the front airbags \nwork together. The knee airbags limit the forward \nmotion of the front seat occupants by restricting leg \nmovement, thereby positioning the occupants so that \nthe front airbags work more effectively.\u2022 Seat-mounted side airbags: A seat-mounted side \nairbag in the front seats helps protect the pelvis and \nthe thorax region of the torso. The seat-mounted side \nairbags on both the impacted and non-impacted side \nof the vehicle will inflate  in the event of severe side \nimpact or severe offset  frontal impact.\n\u2022 Curtain airbags: Curtain airbags help protect the \nhead. Curtain airbags on both the impacted and non-\nimpacted side of the vehicle will inflate  only if a \nsevere side impact occurs, or if the vehicle rolls over.\nAirbag Status Indicator\nThe status of the passenger front airbag displays in the \ntop corner of the touchscreen:\nBefore driving with a child seated on the \nfront passenger seat (if legally permitted \nin your market region), always double-\ncheck the status of the passenger front \nairbag to confirm  that it is OFF.

This is convenient if you \nforget to close your garage door, want to \nallow friends and family inside, or need the \ngarage to open or close automatically \nwhen your vehicle is detected nearby.\nFollow these steps to set up myQ on your vehicle:\n1. Your garage door must be myQ compatible. Use the \nmyQ Compatibility tool ( https://www.myq.com/app/\nmyq-compatibility ) to determine this.\n2. Ensure your garage is Wi-Fi compatible. myQ uses \nWi-Fi to communicate with your smart phone and \nvehicle. Some garages will have a Wi-Fi or myQ \nsymbol on the hub. Your garage must have a strong \nWi-Fi signal to control and monitor your garage \nthrough your vehicle.\nNOTE:  If your garage is not compatible, you may be \nable to purchase an external myQ hub to use this \nfeature.\n3. Download the myQ app from your smart phone's app \nstore. Use the app to set up your account information \nand pair the garage to your phone. myQ requires a \npaid subscription, which you can purchase in the app.\n4. Check that your vehicle is running the latest available \nsoftware version and has Wi-Fi or LTE connectivity.\n5. Touch the garage icon at the top of the touchscreen \nor navigate to Controls  > Locks  > myQ Connected \nGarage  > Link Account  and follow the instructions to \npair the garage with Model 3 . Once paired, \nmonitoring and controlling the garage becomes \navailable on the touchscreen, where you can further \ncustomize myQ.\nFor more information, questions, or troubleshooting \nassistance, visit www.myQ.com/Tesla .\nHomeLink Universal Transceiver\nIf your vehicle is equipped with the \nHomeLink\u00ae Universal Transceiver, you can \noperate up to three Radio Frequency (RF) \ndevices, including garage doors, gates, \nlights, and security systems.\nNOTE:  Depending on date of manufacture, market \nregion, and options selected at time of purchase, some \nvehicles are not equipped with a HomeLink Universal \nTransceiver.\nWARNING:  Do not use the HomeLink Universal \nTransceiver with a device that does not have safety \nstop and reverse features. Using a device without \nthese safety features increases the risk of injury or \ndeath.\nSupported Modes\nHomeLink supports three different  transmit modes, \nwhich is how your vehicle and the RF device \ncommunicate. Selecting a transmit mode is determined \nby your RF device's compatibility:\n\u2022 Standard Mode : Use Standard Mode if your RF device \nis equipped with a remote control that must be used \nto operate the device (for example, a remote-\ncontrolled garage door). This mode is the most \ncommonly used transmit mode for HomeLink \ndevices.\n\u2022 D-Mode or UR-Mode : Use D-Mode or UR-Mode if the \nRF device does not have a remote control, and the \nreceiver has a \"Learn\" button (may also be called \n\"Program\" or \"Smart\"). D-Mode and UR-Mode \nfunction similarly in that Model 3  communicates \ndirectly with the device's receiver as opposed to the \nremote control.\nNOTE:  D-Mode is used primarily in North America \nwhereas UR-Mode is popular in Europe, the Middle \nEast, and Asia. To determine the mode your device is \ncompatible with, contact HomeLink \n(www.homelink.com  or call 1-800-355-3515 ).\nEach of your devices can be set to a different  mode. For \nexample, your garage door can be set to Standard \nMode, your front gate can be set to D-Mode, etc. To \nchange a transmit mode, touch the HomeLink icon at \nthe top of the Controls  screen  and select the device you \nwant to change. Then, select Program  and choose the \ndesired mode for your device. Confirm  by touching Set \nMode  and follow the onscreen instructions.\nFor older vehicles, changing the mode for one device \nchanges the mode for all devices, so be careful when \nchanging transmit modes. Devices not compatible with \nyour selected mode may not work. Touch the HomeLink \nicon at the top of the touchscreen, then touch Change \nTransmit Mode .\nNOTE:  Check the product information for your \nHomeLink device to determine which mode is \ncompatible with your device.\nProgramming HomeLink\nTo program HomeLink\u00ae:\n1.

Model \n3 automatically powers back on again if you press the \nbrake pedal or touch the touchscreen.\nNOTE:  Model 3  automatically shifts into Park whenever it \ndetermines that you are exiting the vehicle (for example, \nthe driver's seat belt is unbuckled and the vehicle is \nalmost at a standstill). If you shift into Neutral, Model 3 \nshifts into Park when you open the door to exit. To keep \nModel 3  in Neutral, you will need to activate Transport \nMode (see Instructions for Transporters  on page 221 ).\nPower Cycling the Vehicle\nYou can power cycle Model 3  if it demonstrates unusual \nbehavior or displays a nondescript alert.\nNOTE:  If the touchscreen is unresponsive or \ndemonstrates unusual behavior, reboot it before you \npower cycle the vehicle (see Restarting the Touchscreen \non page 7 ).\n1. Shift into Park.\n2. On the touchscreen, touch Controls  > Safety  > Power \nOff.\n3. Wait for at least two minutes without interacting with \nthe vehicle.

It is the driver's \nresponsibility to make sure that the headlights are \nappropriately adjusted for weather conditions and \ndriving circumstances.\nHeadlights After Exit\nWhen Headlights after Exit  is on, the exterior headlights \nremain on when you stop driving and park Model 3  in \nlow lighting conditions. They automatically turn off after \none minute or when Model 3  locks. When off, headlights \nturn off when you engage Park and open a door.\nNOTE:  If you lock Model 3  using the Tesla mobile app or \nkey card, the headlights immediately turn off. However, if \nthe vehicle locks because Walk-Away Door Lock is \nenabled (see Walk-Away Door Lock  on page 23 ), the \nheadlights automatically turn off after one minute.\nTo turn this feature on or off, touch Controls  > Lights  > \nHeadlights after Exit .\nHeadlight Adjustments\nTo adjust the angle of the headlights, touch Controls  > \nService  > Adjust Headlights , then follow the onscreen \ninstructions. You can choose which headlight you would \nlike to adjust by selecting it on the touchscreen.\nNOTE:  Headlights do not require adjustments when \ntemporarily driving into a region where the traffic \ndirection is different  (for example, driving in right-hand \ntraffic  region, and then driving into a region with left-\nhand traffic).\nWARNING:  Proceed with caution when adjusting \nheadlights. Tesla has carefully calibrated the \nposition of the headlights to be in an optimum \nposition for most driving scenarios. Tesla \nrecommends that you do not adjust headlights \nunless you are familiar with how headlights should \nbe adjusted. Once adjusted, you will be unable to \nautomatically restore them to their originally \ncalibrated position. Contact Tesla for assistance \nwhen adjusting headlights.\nTurn Signals\nThe turn signals flash  three times or continuously, \ndepending on how far up or down you move the stalk. \nLightly push the turn signal stalk up or down for a three-\nflash  sequence. For a continuous signal, push the stalk \nfully up or down.Lights\n68 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce4522ce-e90d-460e-8a7c-8bb7320519be": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce4522ce-e90d-460e-8a7c-8bb7320519be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d4a5b03-295c-4198-842c-4043efadc565", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f66d85bab1ecafc6685afefbb5d9fd86f1ef3346b667e959b26eff70838fd943", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70091d20-b0b1-4701-97b0-88e441acd264", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "bf09f01de69e64d99cbc30c9d8a67344fe505fd3b2e5206c4d159300e7b3a0c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00126345-2fde-404a-b33d-fe55b4811777", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "e3914ecf6d131d592c93744fcc39256b4cad8e167cf098301524ce4ab72f9dcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bd97a732878ca5e8b586ec67e67df3268578a01955c691b244b5f25f869932d5", "text": "The turn signals stop operating when canceled by the \nsteering wheel, by moving the stalk in the opposite \ndirection, or lightly pushing the stalk in the same \ndirection once more.\nIf Controls  > Lights  > Automatic Turn Signals  is set to \nAuto Cancel , turn signals cancel automatically when \nModel 3  detects completion of a maneuver such as a \nmerge, lane change, or a fork in the roadway.

If you experience a \nproblem with the brake pedal, brake calipers, or \nany component of a Model 3  braking system, \ncontact Tesla immediately.\nModel 3  has an anti-lock braking system (ABS) that \nprevents the wheels from locking when you apply \nmaximum brake pressure. This improves steering control \nduring heavy braking in most road conditions.\nDuring emergency braking conditions, the ABS \nconstantly monitors the speed of each wheel and varies \nthe brake pressure according to the grip available.\nThe alteration of brake pressure can be felt as a pulsing \nsensation through the brake pedal. This demonstrates \nthat the ABS is operating and is not a cause for concern. \nKeep firm and steady pressure on the brake pedal while \nexperiencing the pulsing.\nThe ABS indicator briefly  flashes  amber on \nthe touchscreen  when you first start Model \n3. If this indicator lights up at any other \ntime, an ABS fault has occurred and the \nABS is not operating. Contact Tesla. The \nbraking system remains fully operational \nand is not affected  by an ABS failure. \nHowever, braking distances may increase. \nDrive cautiously and avoid heavy braking.\nIf the touchscreen  displays this red brake \nindicator at any time other than briefly \nwhen you first start Model 3 , a brake \nsystem fault is detected, or the level of the \nbrake fluid is low. Contact Tesla \nimmediately. Apply steady pressure and \nkeep the brakes firm to bring the vehicle to \na stop when safe to do so.\nThe touchscreen  displays this amber brake \nindicator if a brake booster fault is \ndetected. Apply steady pressure and keep \nthe brakes firm to stop the vehicle when \nsafety permits. Hydraulic Boost \nCompensation will be active (see Hydraulic \nBoost Compensation  on page 72 ).\nEmergency Braking\nIn an emergency, fully press the brake pedal and \nmaintain firm pressure, even on low traction surfaces. \nThe ABS varies the braking pressure to each wheel \naccording to the amount of traction available. This \nprevents wheels from locking and ensures that you stop \nas safely as possible.If an alternative method is needed to bring the vehicle to \na stop, press and hold the Park button on the drive stalk \nto apply the brakes and remove drive torque while the \nbutton is held.\nWARNING:  Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so \ninterrupts operation of the ABS and can increase \nbraking distance.\nWARNING:  Always maintain a safe distance from \nthe vehicle in front of you and be aware of \nhazardous driving conditions. While the ABS can \nimprove stopping distance, it cannot overcome the \nlaws of physics. It also does not prevent the \ndanger of hydroplaning (where a layer of water \nprevents direct contact between the tires and the \nroad).\nCAUTION:  Automatic Emergency Braking (see \nCollision Avoidance Assist  on page 126 ) may \nintervene to automatically brake in situations \nwhere a collision is considered imminent. \nAutomatic Emergency Braking is not designed to \nprevent a collision. At best, it can minimize the \nimpact of a frontal collision by attempting to \nreduce your driving speed. Depending on \nAutomatic Emergency Braking to avoid a collision \ncan result in serious injury or death.\nCAUTION:  In emergency situations, if the brakes \nare not functioning properly, press and hold the \nPark button on the drive stalk  to bring Model 3  to \na stop. Do not use this method to stop the vehicle \nunless absolutely necessary.\nDynamic Brake Lights (if equipped)\nIf you are driving over 30 mph (50 km/h)  and brake \nforcefully (or if Automatic Emergency Braking engages) , \nthe brake lights flash  quickly to warn other drivers that \nModel 3  is rapidly slowing down. If Model 3  stops \ncompletely, the hazard warning lights flash.  Flashing \ncontinues until you press the accelerator or manually \npress the hazard lights button to turn them off (see \nHazard Warning Flashers  on page 69 ).\nNOTE:  Dynamic brake lights will not flash  while Track \nMode is enabled (see Track Mode  on page 80 ).\nNOTE:  When towing a trailer (if applicable), the brake \nlights on the trailer also operate as described above, \neven when the trailer is not equipped with a separate \nbraking system.\nWARNING:  When towing a trailer (if applicable), \nalways increase your following distance.

If reduced brake performance is detected \n(for example, as a result of brake fade, or cold or wet \nconditions), you may hear a sound, feel the brake pedal \npull away from your foot, and notice a strong increase in \nbraking. Brake as you normally would and continue to \npress the brake pedal without releasing or pumping the \nbrakes.\nCAUTION:  In emergency situations, if the brakes \nare not functioning properly, press and hold the \nPark button on the drive stalk  to bring Model 3  to \na stop. Do not use this method to stop the vehicle \nunless absolutely necessary.\nWARNING:  Always maintain a safe driving distance \nfrom the vehicle in front of you and exercise \ncaution when driving conditions are hazardous. \nBrake disc wiping and hydraulic fade \ncompensation is not a substitute for adequately \napplying the brakes.\nHydraulic Boost Compensation\nModel 3  is equipped with a brake booster that activates \nthe brakes when the brake pedal is pressed. Hydraulic \nboost compensation provides mechanical assistance if \nthe brake booster fails. If a brake booster failure is \ndetected, the brake pedal feels stiffer  to press and you \nmay hear a sound when you press the brake pedal. To \nstop Model 3 , apply steady force to the brake pedal \nwithout releasing or pumping. Drive cautiously and \nmaintain a safe distance from other road users\u2014brake \npedal responsiveness and braking performance may be \ndegraded.\nRegenerative Braking\nWhenever Model 3  is moving and your foot is off the \naccelerator, regenerative braking slows down the vehicle \nand feeds any surplus power back to the Battery. By \nanticipating your stops and reducing or removing \npressure from the accelerator pedal to slow down, you \ncan take advantage of regenerative braking to increase \ndriving range.Vehicle deceleration due to regenerative braking may \nvary depending on the current state of the Battery. For \nexample, regenerative braking may be limited if the \nBattery is cold or is already fully charged.\nTo experience the same amount of deceleration \nwhenever you release the accelerator pedal, regardless \nof the state of the Battery, you can choose to have the \nregular braking system automatically engage whenever \nregenerative braking is limited. Touch Controls  > Pedals \n& Steering  > Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking \nis Limited .\nWARNING:  Apply Brakes When Regenerative \nBraking is Limited  may not operate if the brakes \nare extremely hot.\nNOTE:  If Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is \nLimited  is enabled and applying the brakes, the brake \npedal may move and it may feel stiffer  when pressed. \nThis is expected and does not change your ability to \nslow down Model 3 .\nThe power meter (a thin horizontal line centered at the \ntop of the touchscreen's car status area ) displays real-\ntime power usage:\n1. The left side of the power meter represents power \ngenerated from regenerative braking, or power that is \nused to slow down the vehicle. Power being fed back \nto the Battery displays in green whereas power used \nby the regular braking system displays in gray.\n2. The right side of the power meter shows power being \noutput by the Battery, such as that used to accelerate \nthe vehicle or to cool the cabin. When you press the \naccelerator pedal, the power meter fills to the right \nwith black (or white if the display is dark).\nNOTE:  To ensure visibility when the display is dark, \npower represented by the gray color displays as white.\nNOTE:  Installing winter tires with aggressive compound \nand tread design may result in temporarily-reduced \nregenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is \ndesigned to continuously recalibrate itself, and after \nchanging tires it will increasingly restore regenerative \nbraking power after some straight-line accelerations. For \nmost drivers this occurs after a short period of normal \ndriving, but drivers who normally accelerate lightly may \nneed to use slightly harder accelerations while the \nrecalibration is in progress.

To avoid the accumulation \nof rust and corrosion, Tesla recommends frequently \npressing the brake pedal to apply the mechanical brakes \nand dry the brake pads and rotors.\nWARNING:  In snowy or icy conditions, Model 3 \nmay experience loss of traction during \nregenerative braking. \nStopping Mode\nRegenerative braking decelerates Model 3  whenever you \nrelease the accelerator pedal when driving. You can \nchoose what you want Model 3  to do once the driving \nspeed has been reduced to a very low speed (almost at \na stop) and both the accelerator pedal and brake pedal \nare released. While in Park, touch Controls  > Pedals & \nSteering  > Stopping Mode  and choose from these \noptions:\n\u2022 Creep : When close to, or at, a complete stop, the \nmotor continues to apply torque, moving Model 3 \nslowly forward (in Drive) or backwards (in Reverse), \nsimilar to a conventional vehicle with an automatic \ntransmission. In some situations, such as on a steep \nhill or driveway, you may need to press the \naccelerator pedal to continue moving or to prevent \nModel 3  from moving in the opposite direction.\nWARNING:  Never rely on Creep  to apply \nenough torque to prevent your vehicle from \nrolling down a hill. Always press the brake pedal \nto remain stopped or the accelerator pedal to \nproceed up the hill. Failure to do so can result in \nproperty damage and/or a collision.\n\u2022 Hold : Maximizes range and reduces brake wear by \ncontinuing to provide regenerative braking at speeds \nlower than with the Creep and Roll settings. When \nModel 3  stops, the brakes are automatically applied \nwithout you having to put your foot on the brake \npedal. Whether stopped on a flat surface or a hill, \nVehicle Hold keeps the brake applied, provided your \nfoot remains off the accelerator and brake pedals. \nSee Vehicle Hold  on page 77 .\nWARNING:  Never rely on Hold  to adequately \ndecelerate or fully stop your vehicle. Many \nfactors can contribute to a longer stopping \ndistance, including downward slopes, and \nreduced or limited regenerative braking (see \nRegenerative Braking  on page 72 ). Always be \nprepared to use the brake pedal to adequately \ndecelerate or stop.\n\u2022 Roll: When close to, or at, a complete stop, Model 3 \nbecomes free rolling like a vehicle in Neutral. \nTherefore, if stopped on a slope, Model 3  will roll \ndownward. The brake does not engage, and the \nmotor does not apply torque (until the accelerator \npedal is pressed).NOTE:  If you choose Creep  or Roll, you can still use \nVehicle Hold to apply the brakes. However, you will \nneed to briefly  press the brake pedal when the \nvehicle is stopped. See Vehicle Hold  on page 77 .\nNOTE:  When Model 3  is in Track Mode (see Track \nMode  on page 80 ), Roll is automatically enabled, \nregardless of your chosen setting. When no longer in \nTrack Mode, Model 3  reverts to your chosen setting.\nNOTE:  Your preferred Stopping Mode setting does not \nsync to your driver profile.\nWARNING:  Press the brake pedal if Model 3  moves \nwhen unsafe to do so. It is your responsibility to \nstay alert and be in control of the vehicle at all \ntimes. Failure to do so can result in serious \ndamage, injury, or death.\nWARNING:  Do not rely on regenerative braking \nand your chosen Stopping Mode to keep you and \nyour vehicle safe. Various factors such as driving \nwith a heavy vehicle load, on a steep hill, or on wet \nor icy roads affect  deceleration rate and the \ndistance at which Model 3  will come to a stop. \nDrive attentively and always stay prepared to use \nthe brake pedal to stop as appropriate based on \ntraffic  and road conditions.\nWARNING:  Forward Collision Warning and \nAutomatic Emergency Braking do not operate \nwhen driving at very low speeds (see Collision \nAvoidance Assist  on page 126 ).

Additionally, Tesla \nrecommends cleaning and lubricating the brake calipers \nevery year or 12,500 miles (20,000 km)  if in an area \nwhere roads are salted during winter months.\nWARNING:  Neglecting to replace worn brake pads \ndamages the braking system and can result in a \nbraking hazard.Braking and Stopping\n74 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab9037ac-aacb-492b-86a8-934a0606a6e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab9037ac-aacb-492b-86a8-934a0606a6e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6342e718-3867-47c1-9174-a09fa20d5859", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "cfa310199e03559818e8c3b047d7b511da59a48c654591b6f87e2c6097628699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59c29b99-a6c0-4e24-85a0-fe17bb72412d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f98182112e0f3c469e8ed6ea11416a045e93fb7bb4fe5c0aee982884d029e240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a538e55-6ed7-43b5-858e-b744206612bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "e3565104ae06ffc4793073611066c185ba378e95538d0ae467ad14677784807a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f0d4d2ee92ea1cc9fc0cdf47b928ffe422473b4c4eb95f10ea8093ffd184fa7d", "text": "How Park Assist Works\nThis feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until \nit is enabled with a future software update for vehicles \nmanufactured as of approximately October 2022.\nModel 3  is designed to detect the presence of objects. \nWhen driving slowly in Drive or Reverse (for example, \nwhen parking), the vehicle alerts you if an object is \ndetected in close proximity of your Model 3 . Objects are \nonly detected in your chosen direction; front objects in \nDrive, rear objects in Reverse.\nWARNING:  You may not be alerted if Model 3  rolls \nfreely in the opposite direction (for example, Park \nAssist does not display an alert if Model 3  rolls \nbackwards down a hill while in Drive).\nPark Assist is activated when driving slower than 5 mph \n(8 km/h) .\nWARNING:  Never depend on Park Assist to inform \nyou if an area you are approaching is free of \nobjects and/or people. Several external factors can \nreduce the performance of Park Assist, causing \neither no readings or false readings (see \nLimitations and False Warnings  on page 75 ). \nTherefore, depending on Park Assist to determine \nif Model 3  is approaching an obstruction can result \nin damage to the vehicle and/or objects, and can \npotentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the \narea with your own eyes. When reversing, perform \nshoulder checks and use all mirrors. Park assist \ndoes not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, \nanimals, or objects that are moving, protruding, \nlocated too far above or below the sensors (if \nequipped) or cameras, or too close or too far from \nthe sensors or cameras. Park Assist is for guidance \npurposes only and is not intended to replace your \nown direct visual checks. It is not a substitute for \ncareful driving.\nVisual and Audio Feedback\nWhen you shift to Reverse, the Park Assist view displays \non the touchscreen , showing objects that are in close \nproximity to the front and rear of Model 3 . This view \ncloses when you shift into Drive unless an object is \ndetected close to the front of Model 3 , in which case the \nPark Assist view closes automatically when your driving \nspeed exceeds 5 mph (8 km/h) . When reversing, visual \nfeedback also displays on the touchscreen (see Rear \nFacing Camera(s)  on page 85 ). You can manually close \nthe park assist view on the touchscreen by touching the \nX.\nWhen driving with the Camera app displayed on the \ntouchscreen, you can switch to the Park Assist view \nwhen driving at speeds below 5 mph (8 km/h) . Touch \nthe button located in the upper left corner of the \nCamera app screen. This is useful if you need assistance \nwith parallel parking.If chimes are turned on (see Controlling Audible \nFeedback  on page 75 ), an audible beep sounds as you \napproach an object.\nNOTE:  If Park Assist is unable to provide feedback, the \ntouchscreen  displays an alert message.\nCAUTION:  Keep sensors (if equipped) and \ncameras clean from dirt, debris, snow, and ice. \nAvoid using a high pressure power washer on the \nsensors and cameras, and do not clean a sensor or \ncamera with a sharp or abrasive object that can \nscratch or damage its surface.\nCAUTION:  Do not install accessories or stickers on \nor near the sensors (if equipped) or cameras.\nControlling Audible Feedback\nYou can use Park Assist with or without audible \nfeedback. To turn chimes on or off, touch Controls  > \nSafety  > Park Assist Chimes .\nLimitations and False Warnings\nPark Assist may not function correctly in these \nsituations:\n\u2022 One or more of the sensors (if equipped)  or cameras \nis damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, \nor snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or \nadhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber \ncoating, etc.).\n\u2022 The object is located below approximately 8 inches \n(20 cm)  (such as a curb or low barrier).\nCAUTION:  Shorter objects that are detected \n(such as curbs or low barriers) can move into a \nblind spot.

When \nyou drive Model 3  through the start/finish  location, the \nLap Timer automatically starts timing the duration of the \nlap, resetting the timer whenever you pass the start/\nfinish  location, and displaying the real-time delta \nbetween the current lap and the fastest lap so far in the \ndriving session. The map highlights the track in blue.\nAt the completion of each lap, the Lap Timer displays \nthe duration of the lap. It also displays the times \nassociated with the previous and best laps in the driving \nsession.If Save Dashcam for Laps  is on (see Customizing Track \nMode  on page 80 ), and a properly formatted USB flash \ndrive is inserted in a front USB port, Track Mode saves a \nvideo of the driving session (as recorded by the front \ncameras), along with a .CSV file that provides detailed \ninformation about the lap.\nNOTE:  To stop the timer at the end of your driving \nsession, touch STOP  on the Lap Timer popup window.\nMonitoring Vehicle Health\nYou can easily monitor the health of Model 3  when using \nTrack Mode by glancing at the car status area of the \ntouchscreen. The colors indicate the status of the \nvarious components, allowing you to determine the \ncurrent operating state and make decisions accordingly. \nThe components are displayed in green when operating \nwithin their ideal temperature range.

To link a driver profile \nto a key, first ensure you are using your desired driver \nprofile,  then touch Controls  > Locks  > Keys . You can \ntoggle the driver icon to link or delete a key to the \ndesired driver profile.  The name of the driver profile \nappears under the key to show that it is linked.\nNOTE:  Model 3  supports up to 10 driver profiles.  You can \nlink multiple keys to a driver profile,  but you cannot link \nmultiple driver profiles  to a single key.\nEasy Entry\nYou can define  an Easy Entry setting that moves the \nsteering wheel  and driver's seat to make it easy to enter \nand exit Model 3 . Any driver can use the Easy Entry \nsetting by associating it with their driver profile.  When \nthe Easy Entry setting is associated with a driver profile,  \nthe steering wheel  and driver's seat automatically adjust \nwhen in Park and the driver's seat belt is unbuckled, \nallowing an easy exit from Model 3 . When returning to \nthe vehicle and stepping on the brake pedal, settings \nautomatically adjust back to the settings used by the \nmost recent driver profile  (or based on the key if it's \nlinked to a driver profile).\nTo use Easy Entry  with a driver profile,  ensure the Use \nEasy Entry  box is checked.\nWARNING:  Never use Easy Entry to move the \ndriver's seat to the full rearward position when a \nchild safety seat is installed on a rear seat located \nbehind the driver's seat. With reduced clearance, \nthe movement of the seat may impact a child's \nlegs, cause injury, or dislodge the seat.\nValet Mode\nWhen Model 3  is in Valet mode, the following restrictions \napply:\n\u2022 Key card must be used to access and drive Model 3 .\n\u2022 Speed is limited to 70 mph (113 km/h) .\n\u2022 Maximum acceleration and power are limited.\n\u2022 Front trunk and glovebox are locked.\n\u2022 Home and Work locations are not available in the \nnavigation system.\n\u2022 Voice commands are disabled.\n\u2022 Autopilot convenience features are disabled.\n\u2022 The Allow Mobile Access setting cannot be changed.\n\u2022 HomeLink (if available in your market region) is not \naccessible.\u2022 Driver Profiles  are not accessible.\n\u2022 Some apps, such as Toybox and Theater, are not \naccessible.\n\u2022 The touchscreen does not display the list of keys that \ncan access Model 3  (see Managing Keys  on page 21 ).\n\u2022 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. When Model 3  is in \nValet mode, you cannot pair new Bluetooth devices \nor view or delete existing paired devices. However, if \na Bluetooth-paired device or a known Wi-Fi network \nis within range, Model 3  connects to it.\nStarting Valet Mode\nWith Model 3  in Park, touch the driver profile  icon at the \ntop of the Controls  screen , then touch Valet Mode .\nThe first time you enter Valet mode, the touchscreen \nprompts you to create a 4-digit PIN you will use to \ncancel Valet mode.\nWhen Valet mode is active, the touchscreen  displays the \nword Valet  while the driver profile  changes to Valet \nMode  on the touchscreen.\nYou can also use the mobile app to start and cancel \nValet mode (if Model 3  is in Park).

However, Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control \nalso slows down or accelerates Model 3  as needed to \nmaintain the following distance from the vehicle in \nfront of you. While Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control is \nengaged, you are still responsible for steering Model \n3 (see Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control  on page 91 ).\n\u2022 Autosteer:  Like Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control, \nAutosteer maintains a set speed (if there is not a \nvehicle in front of you) or a set following distance (if \nthere is a vehicle in front of you). In addition, \nAutosteer detects lane markings, road edges, and the \npresence of vehicles and objects to intelligently keep \nModel 3  in its driving lane (see Autosteer  on page \n92).\nNOTE:  Autosteer is a BETA feature.\n\u2022 Auto Lane Change : When you engage a turn signal \nwhile Autosteer is active, Auto Lane Change moves \nModel 3  into the adjacent lane in the direction \nindicated by the turn signal (see Auto Lane Change \non page 92 ).\n\u2022 Navigate on Autopilot:  Navigate on Autopilot builds \non the features of Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control and \nAutosteer. While Autosteer is active, Navigate on \nAutopilot allows Model 3  to suggest and, if \nconfigured,  automatically change lanes to pass other \nvehicles and follow the navigation route (see \nNavigate on Autopilot  on page 93 ).\nNOTE:  Navigate on Autopilot is a BETA feature.\nTraffic-Aware  Cruise Control and Autosteer use \ninformation from the cameras on Model 3  to detect lane \nmarkings, road edges, and other vehicles and road users \naround Model 3 .\nCAUTION:  Before using Autopilot features, ensure \nthat all cameras are clean and free of obstructions \n(see #unique_294  on page ). Dirty cameras and \nsensors (if equipped), as well as environmental \nconditions such as rain and faded lane markings, \naffect  Autopilot performance.\nCAUTION:  It is your responsibility to familiarize \nyourself with the limitations of Autopilot and the \nsituations in which driver intervention may be \nneeded. For more information, see Limitations and \nWarnings  on page 117 .\nAutopilot Settings\nBefore you use Autopilot features, customize how they \nwork by touching Controls  > Autopilot .\u2022 Set Speed : Choose whether Autopilot engages at the \ncurrently detected speed limit or your current driving \nspeed. Touch Controls  > Autopilot  > Set Speed  and \nchoose either Speed Limit  or Current Speed .\n\u2022 Offset : If you choose Speed Limit , you can specify an \noffset  by touching Set Speed Offset .

For \nexample, Autopilot remains active even if Model 3  slows \ndown to a complete or near-complete stop in heavy, \nstop-and-go traffic  on a highway. When traffic  starts \nmoving more rapidly, Autopilot again accelerates up to \nthe set speed.\nSometimes when Model 3  is at a full stop, Autopilot goes \ninto a HOLD state. If this happens, briefly  press the \naccelerator pedal to resume cruising.\nWhen the HOLD status is active, the \ntouchscreen  displays the HOLD icon and a \nmessage that indicates that you need to \nresume cruise control.\nModel 3  goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active \nin the following circumstances:\n\u2022 Model 3  has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.\n\u2022 Model 3  detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may \nclear when the pedestrian is no longer detected).\n\u2022 Model 3  suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in \nfront of you.\n\u2022 An obstacle is detected in front of Model 3 .\nCruising Near or On Exits\nWhen you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-\naccess highway and engage the turn signal toward the \noff-ramp,  Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins \nto slow down Model 3 . If you do not drive onto the off-\nramp,  Autopilot resumes cruising at the set speed.In a region with right hand traffic,  this occurs only when \nyou engage the right turn signal when driving in the \nright-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters)  of an exit. \nLikewise in regions with left hand traffic,  this occurs \nwhen engaging the left turn signal when driving in the \nleft-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters)  of an exit.\nNOTE:  If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model 3  will \nperform a route-based lane change to enter the exit lane \nand take the off-ramp  as necessary to follow the \nnavigation route.\nWhen enabled while on a highway interchange or off-\nramp,  Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may reduce your set \nspeed in 5 mph (5 km/h)  increments \u2013 to as slow as \n25 mph (40 km/h)  \u2013 to better match the reported \nspeeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that \nspecific  location. To override this and continue cruising \nat your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal. The new set \nspeed is maintained for the duration of the interchange \nor off-ramp  (unless you override it or cancel Autopilot). \nAfter the interchange or off-ramp,  the set speed may \nrevert or change as necessary based on the new \nlocation. For example, if you merged onto a different  \nhighway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was \nbefore driving on the interchange.\nWARNING:  In some cases (such as having \ninsufficient  data), Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may \nnot automatically reduce the set speed on the \nhighway interchange or off-ramp.  Do not rely on \nTraffic-Aware  Cruise Control to determine an \nappropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends \ndriving at a speed that is safe for road conditions \nand within posted speed limits.\nWhen cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access \nhighway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising \nspeed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset \nyou have specified.  If Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, \nit disengages as you leave the controlled-access \nhighway (see Canceling Autopilot  on page 94 ). In this \ncase, Autosteer remains active.\nOvertake Acceleration\nEngage the turn signal momentarily to accelerate Model \n3 towards the vehicle ahead of it.

Traffic  Light and Stop Sign \nControl attempts to stop at all traffic  lights and may also \nstop at green lights.\nTraffic  Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to \nrecognize and respond to traffic  lights and stop signs, \nslowing Model 3  to a stop when using Traffic-Aware  \ncruise control or Autosteer. This feature uses the \nvehicle's forward-facing cameras, in addition to GPS \ndata, and slows the car for all detected traffic  lights, \nincluding green, blinking yellow, and off lights in addition \nto stop signs and some road markings. As Model 3 \napproaches an intersection, the touchscreen  displays a \nnotification  indicating the intention to slow down. You \nmust confirm  that you want to continue or Model 3 \nstops at the red line displayed on the touchscreen's \ndriving visualization.\nWARNING:  NEVER  make assumptions and predict \nwhen and where Traffic  Light and Stop Sign \nControl will stop or continue through an \nintersection or road marking. From a driver's \nperspective, the behavior of Traffic  Light and Stop \nSign Control may appear inconsistent. Always pay \nattention to the roadway and be prepared to take \nimmediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to \ndetermine whether to stop or continue through an \nintersection. Never depend on Traffic  Light and \nStop Sign Control to determine when it is safe \nand/or appropriate to stop or continue through an \nintersection.\nBefore Using\nBefore using Traffic  Light and Stop Sign Control, you \nmust:\n\u2022 Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed \n(see Cleaning a Camera  on page 183 ) and calibrated \n(see Drive to Calibrate Cameras  on page 16 ). Traffic \nLight and Stop Sign Control depends on the ability of \nthe cameras to detect traffic  lights, stop signs, and \nroad markings.\n\u2022 Ensure that the latest version of maps has been \ndownloaded to Model 3 . Although Traffic  Light and \nStop Sign Control primarily uses visual data received \nfrom the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is \nachieved when using the most recent map data. To \ncheck which version of maps is currently \ndownloaded, touch Controls  > Software . You must \nconnect to a Wi-Fi network to receive updated maps \n(see Map Updates  on page 153 ).\u2022 Enable the feature. With the vehicle in Park, touch \nControls  > Autopilot  > Traffic  Light and Stop Sign \nControl . Once enabled, Traffic  Light and Stop Sign \nControl operates whenever Traffic-Aware  Cruise \nControl or Autosteer is active.\nHow it Works\nWhen Traffic  Light and Stop Sign Control is enabled and \nyou are using Autosteer, Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control, or \nFull Self-Driving (Beta), the touchscreen  displays a \npopup message to inform you that an upcoming traffic \nlight, stop sign, or road marking has been detected. As it \napproaches the stop location, even at an intersection \nwhere the traffic  light is green, Model 3  slows down and \ndisplays a red line to indicate where Model 3  will stop. To \ncontinue through the intersection\u2014even if the traffic \nlight is green \u2014you must press down on the drive stalk \nor briefly  press the accelerator pedal to give the vehicle \npermission to proceed. When you've confirmed  that you \nwant to proceed, the red stop line turns gray and Model \n3 continues through the intersection and resumes your \nset cruising speed.\nNOTE:  If Model 3  is approaching a green light and \ndetects that a vehicle in front of you is continuing \nthrough the intersection, Model 3  continues through the \nintersection without requiring your confirmation,  \nprovided you are not in a turning lane and the vehicle \ncan detect that your hands are on the steering wheel .\nNOTE:  If, after you press down on the drive stalk or \nbriefly  press the accelerator pedal to confirm  that you \nwant to continue through the intersection, the traffic \nsignal changes before you enter the intersection (for \nexample, the light changes from green to yellow or from \nyellow to red), Model 3  may determine that it is not \nappropriate to proceed.

You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any \ntype of roadway, including residential and city streets.\nAlways remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not \nmake Model 3  autonomous and requires a fully attentive \ndriver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. \nWhile Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must \nmonitor your surroundings and other road users at all \ntimes.\nDriver intervention may be required in certain situations, \nsuch as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in \nconstruction zones, or while going through complex \nintersections. For more examples of scenarios in which \ndriver intervention might be required, see Limitations \nand Warnings  on page 117 .\nFull Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras \nmounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model 3  to \nbuild a model of the area surrounding Model 3  (see \nCameras  on page 16 ). The Full Self-Driving computer \ninstalled in Model 3  is designed to use this input, rapidly \nprocess neural networks, and make decisions to safely \nguide you to your destination.\nNOTE:  Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta  feature. As \nTesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model \n3 is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. \nDownload updates as soon as they become available.\nLike other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) \nrequires a fully attentive driver and will display a series \nof escalating warnings requiring driver response. You \nmust keep your hands on the steering wheel  while Full \nSelf-Driving (Beta) is engaged.  In addition, the cabin \ncamera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera \non page 16 ).\nUse Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you \nwill pay constant attention to the road and be prepared \nto act immediately, especially around blind corners, \ncrossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. \nFor more information, see Limitations and Warnings  on \npage 117 .\nCAUTION:  As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment \nexpands, Tesla will gradually make it available to \neligible customers in select countries outside of \nthe United States and Canada. Because every \ncountry contains unique infrastructure, driving \nbehaviors, and traffic  patterns that Full Self-\nDriving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is \nessential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) \nin newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and \noverly cautious.

Dirty cameras and sensors, as \nwell as environmental conditions such as rain and \nfaded lane markings, can affect  Autopilot \nperformance.\nWARNING:  Autopark's performance depends on \nthe ability of the cameras and sensors (if \nequipped) to determine the vehicle's proximity to \ncurbs, objects, and other vehicles.\nWARNING:  Do not use Autopark if anything, such \nas a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to \nthe tow hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches \nwhen parking between or in front of other vehicles.\nParameters\nAutopark detects potential parking spaces based on the \nfollowing parameters:\nPerpendicular Parking \n\u2022 Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h) . If \ndriving too fast, Autopark may not be able to \naccurately detect your desired parking space.\n\u2022 The parking space must be at least 7.2 feet (2.2 \nmeters)  wide.\n\u2022 The parking space must have at least three visible \nlines for the vehicle to park into, such as parking lines, \nroad markings, or distinct curbs. Autopark may not \nwork in a garage, for example, without three visible \nparking lines.\n\u2022 Autopark may not work with textured road surfaces \nsuch as cobblestone or brick.\nParallel Parking\n\u2022 Your driving speed must be below 13 mph (21 km/h) . \nIf driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to \naccurately detect your desired parking space.\n\u2022 There must be a vehicle in front of the space you \nwant to park in.\n\u2022 A distinct curb or edge must be visible. Autopark \nmay not correctly identify the parking space if the \ncurb is not distinct, such as grass or dirt.\nNOTE:  Autopark does not operate on angled parking \nspaces.To Use Autopark\nWhen driving, follow these steps to allow Autopark to \nmaneuver Model 3  into a parking space:\n1. While driving slowly, monitor the touchscreen  to see \npotential parking spaces detected by Autopilot. \nWhen Model 3  is positioned such that it can reverse \ninto one of the detected locations, the touchscreen \ndisplays a parking icon.\nNOTE:  The parking icon appears only if the vehicle's \nposition and/or the circumstances of the surrounding \narea are such that Autopark can determine an \nappropriate driving path. If Autopark cannot \ndetermine an appropriate path (for example, when \ndriving on a narrow street where moving into the \nparking space causes the front of the vehicle to \nextend into the adjacent lane), you can either \nreposition the vehicle, find a different  parking space, \nor park manually.\n2. Choose a spot, check to determine if it is appropriate \nand safe, then pull forward and stop approximately \none car length ahead of the parking space (as you \nnormally would when parallel parking or when \nbacking into a perpendicular parking space).\n3. Release the steering wheel , shift Model 3  into \nReverse, then touch Start Autopark  on the \ntouchscreen.\n4. Autopark displays a message when parking is \ncomplete.\nIf you press the brake pedal when Autopark is actively \nparking Model 3 , the parking process pauses until you \ntouch Resume  on the touchscreen.\nWARNING:  Never depend on Autopark to find a \nparking space that is legal, suitable, and safe. \nAutopark may not always detect objects in the \nparking space. Always perform visual checks to \nconfirm  that a parking space is appropriate and \nsafe.Autopark\n110 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11a56b63-4461-48f8-ab02-d5283ef13ca5": {"__data__": {"id_": "11a56b63-4461-48f8-ab02-d5283ef13ca5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ea3d3ad-d116-4a6c-8d21-e0918497c10e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "390e04da95bf201babf750c8cb588d482874eb7648962d884855d4d9b8f6e6ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2399c7e-273c-47a6-b2c9-dc87f9bf631c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "057e45d1f0ffdbb6ae574576c8855c84cb03df878d1d6d450fa101948101a84e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72b57b7f-8441-4d05-89ea-3a7d1a2183f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "6521a4002be37bd640fbefb2abbb3e3af9b264fe00d21f9bb9c8e54d26dcee41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6690ca25a7cf3d92d760fbd3ac2d108806e550c3fa32fdb2bc100038444f545e", "text": "WARNING:  When Autopark is actively steering \nModel 3 :\n\u2022 Do not interfere with the movement of the \nsteering wheel .

Smart Summon \nallows your vehicle to find you (or you can send your \nvehicle to a chosen location). See Smart Summon  on \npage 115 .\nSummon requires that Model 3  can detect a valid key \nnearby.\nWARNING:  Summon is designed and intended for \nuse only on parking lots and driveways on private \nproperty where the surrounding area is familiar \nand predictable.\nWARNING:  Summon is a BETA feature. You must \ncontinually monitor the vehicle and its \nsurroundings and stay prepared to take immediate \naction at any time. It is the driver's responsibility to \nuse Summon safely, responsibly, and as intended. \nFor more information about the limitations of \nSummon and conditions that may interfere with its \nuse, see Warnings and Limitations  on page 117 .\nBefore Using Summon\nBefore operating Summon, use the touchscreen to \nenable it and customize how you want it to work. Touch \nControls  > Autopilot  > Customize Summon  and adjust \nthe following settings to suit your preferences:\n\u2022 Bumper Clearance : Set the distance that you want \nSummon to stop from a detected object (for \nexample, you may want Summon to stop within just a \nfew inches of a garage wall). Note that this distance \napplies only to objects that Summon detects directly \nin front of Model 3  when moving forward, or directly \nbehind Model 3  when reversing.\n\u2022 Summon Distance : Set a maximum distance that \nModel 3  can travel when entering or exiting a parking \nspace.\n\u2022 Side Clearance : Choose an option to specify how \nmuch side clearance you want to allow. Tight  allows \nModel 3  to enter and exit very narrow parking spaces.\nWARNING:  Parking in a narrow space limits the \nability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) \nto accurately detect the location of obstacles, \nincreasing the risk of damage to Model 3 \nand/or surrounding objects.\n\u2022 Require Continuous Press : By default, Summon \nrequires that you press and hold a button on the \nmobile app to move Model 3  during the parking \nprocess. When Require Continuous Press  is set to No, \nyou can press and release the button\u2014you don't need \nto hold it down to keep the vehicle moving.  Also, \nwhen Require Continuous Press  is set to No, you can \noperate Summon using the key fob accessory instead \nof the mobile app (see #unique_317  on page ) and \nyou can start a parking sequence from inside the \nvehicle (see Starting Summon Before Exiting the \nVehicle  on page 113 ).\n\u2022 Use Auto HomeLink  (if equipped): Set to ON if you \nwant to activate HomeLink to open/close a \nprogrammed HomeLink device (such as a gate or a \ngarage door) during the parking process when using \nSummon. If enabled, the device automatically opens \nand closes when Model 3  enters or exits during a \nSummon session.

This is useful for moving \nModel 3  out of a tight parking spot, through puddles, or \nhelping you retrieve your car while carrying packages. \nYou must maintain a clear line of sight between you and \nModel 3  and closely monitor the vehicle and its \nsurroundings at all times.\nCAUTION:  Smart Summon is designed and \nintended for use only on parking lots and \ndriveways located on private property where the \nsurrounding area is familiar and predictable. Do \nnot use Smart Summon on public roads.\nWARNING:  Smart Summon must only be used on \npaved surfaces.\nWARNING:  Smart Summon is a BETA feature. You \nmust continually monitor the vehicle and its \nsurroundings and stay prepared to take immediate \naction at any time. It is the driver's responsibility to \nuse Smart Summon safely, responsibly, and as \nintended. It is your responsibility to familiarize \nyourself with the limitations of Smart Summon \n(see Limitations and Warnings  on page 117 ).\nBefore Using Smart Summon\n\u2022 Download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app \nto your phone, and ensure your phone has cellular \nservice and GPS enabled.\n\u2022 Your phone must be connected to Model 3  and \nlocated within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters) .\n\u2022 The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see \nDrive to Calibrate Cameras  on page 16 ).\n\u2022 You must have a clear line of sight to Model 3 .\n\u2022 Model 3  must be in Park, not charging, and all doors \nand trunks must be closed.\nCAUTION:  Ensure all cameras and sensors (if \nequipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as \nwell as environmental conditions such as rain and \nfaded lane markings, can affect  Autopilot \nperformance.Using Smart Summon\n1. Open the Tesla mobile app, and press Summon .\n2. Press the Smart Summon  icon located in the center \nof the image of your Model 3 . It may take several \nseconds for Smart Summon to start up.\nNOTE:  You can use Standby Mode to eliminate the \ndelay that occurs when Smart Summon is starting up \n(see Standby Mode  on page 116 ).\nThe mobile app displays a map with a blue circle, \nwhich represents the maximum proximity of 213 ft. \n(65 meters)  that you must maintain between your \nphone and Model 3 . The blue dot on the map \nrepresents your location, and the red arrow \nrepresents the vehicle.\n3. Position yourself anywhere within the blue circle \nwhere you have a clear line of sight to Model 3 .\n4. You can now operate Smart Summon using either of \nthese modes:\n\u25e6 Come to Me  mode: Press and hold the Come to \nMe button. Model 3  moves to your GPS location. \nAs you move, Model 3  follows you. When Model 3 \nreaches you, it stops and shifts into park.\n\u25e6 Go to Target  mode: Touch the crosshair icon then \ndrag the map to position the pin on a chosen \ndestination. Press and hold the Go to Target \nbutton. Model 3  moves to the destination. When \nreaching the location, Model 3  stops and shifts \ninto Park and the mobile app displays a message \nindicating that Summon has completed.\nNOTE:  To subsequently change the location, lift \nyour finger,  reposition the map, then press and \nhold Go to Target  again.\nTo stop Model 3  at any time, simply release the Come \nto Me  or Go to Target  button.\nThe map's crosshair icon toggles between \nGo to Target  and Come to Me  modes. \nWhen Come to Me  mode is selected, the \nicon is blue.\nNOTE:  The map also has an icon that \nallows you to display/hide satellite imagery.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4eaa3181-6f65-47bb-b28e-4122d1104674": {"__data__": {"id_": "4eaa3181-6f65-47bb-b28e-4122d1104674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b2a7d0d-a112-4722-89ce-a07ebd5ebec7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "966c6ce51221dce35a84ae44563bae61258062e71649410bea8521e2461a8e26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2edf0b2a-396d-4d58-9bf4-acdffbf96c48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "afdbee892d77638de92860999dc41cf6bfad18617f1bbbe4b5e0789b75a39863", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e785b25-995b-436a-b0b2-b33d393b161a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "1f6d4a08fb62e86caeb414e3224f1fe9ae4e3a2b376167dba4c3195a2485d2b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a6de7c35f1e762d70604a896a81b32c50a7f1407ea25fe31fa98e5862e8fba7", "text": "\u25e6 Go to Target  mode: Touch the crosshair icon then \ndrag the map to position the pin on a chosen \ndestination.

Failure \nto follow all warnings and instructions can result in \nproperty damage, serious injury, or death.\nNOTE:  Ensure all cameras are clean before each drive \nand before using Autopilot features (see #unique_294 \non page ). Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as \nenvironmental conditions such as rain and faded lane \nmarkings, can affect  Autopilot performance. If a camera \nis obstructed or blinded, Model 3  displays a message on \nthe touchscreen  and Autopilot features may not be \navailable.\nTraffic-Aware  Cruise Control\nWhile using Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control, it is the \ndriver\u2019s responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be \nin control of the vehicle at all times.  Always keep your \neyes on the road when driving and be prepared to take \ncorrective action as needed.\nIn addition, it is the driver\u2019s responsibility to cruise at a \nsafe speed and maintain a safe following distance based \non road conditions and applicable speed limits. Be \naware of the following limitations while Traffic-Aware  \nCruise Control is active.\n\u2022 There may be situations where the cruising speed \nmay not change when the speed limit changes.\n\u2022 Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control does not adapt driving \nspeed based on road and driving conditions. Do not \nuse Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control on winding roads \nwith sharp curves, on icy or slippery road surfaces, or \nwhen weather conditions (such as heavy rain, snow, \nfog, etc.) make it inappropriate to drive at a \nconsistent speed.\n\u2022 Do not rely on Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control to \nmaintain an accurate or appropriate following \ndistance.\u2022 Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may be unable to \nprovide adequate speed control because of limited \nbraking capability and hills. It can also misjudge the \ndistance from a vehicle ahead. Driving downhill can \nincrease driving speed, causing Model 3  to exceed \nyour set speed (and potentially the road's speed \nlimit).\n\u2022 Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may occasionally cause \nModel 3  to brake when not required or when you are \nnot expecting it. This can be caused by closely \nfollowing a vehicle ahead, detecting vehicles or \nobjects in adjacent lanes (especially on curves), etc.\n\u2022 Due to limitations inherent in the onboard GPS \n(Global Positioning System), you may experience \nsituations in which Model 3  slows down, especially \nnear exits or off-ramps  where a curve is detected \nand/or you are navigating to a destination and not \nfollowing the route.\n\u2022 In some cases (such as having insufficient  data), \nTraffic-Aware  Cruise Control may not automatically \nreduce the set speed on the highway interchange or \noff-ramp.\n\u2022 Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may not detect all \nobjects and, especially when cruising over 50 mph \n(80 km/h) , may not brake/decelerate when a vehicle \nor object is only partially in the driving lane or when a \nvehicle you are following moves out of your driving \npath and a stationary or slow-moving vehicle or \nobject is in front of you.\n\u2022 Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control may react to vehicles or \nobjects that either do not exist, or are not in your \nlane of travel, causing Model 3  to slow down \nunnecessarily or inappropriately.\nWARNING:  Traffic-Aware  Cruise Control is \nparticularly unlikely to operate as intended in the \nfollowing types of situations:\n\u2022 The road has sharp curves.\n\u2022 Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, \netc.).\n\u2022 Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights \nor direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of \nthe camera(s).\n\u2022 A camera or sensor (if equipped) is obstructed \n(fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).\nWARNING:  The list above does not represent an \nexhaustive list of situations that may interfere with

When a collision is considered \nunavoidable, Automatic Emergency Braking is designed \nto apply the brakes to reduce the vehicle's speed and \ntherefore, the severity of the impact. The amount of \nspeed that is reduced depends on many factors, \nincluding driving speed and environment.\nWhen Automatic Emergency Braking applies the brakes, \nthe touchscreen  displays a visual warning and sounds a \nchime. You may also notice abrupt downward movement \nof the brake pedal.

To disable it for your current drive, \nshift into Park and touch Controls  > Autopilot  > \nAutomatic Emergency Braking . Even if you disable \nAutomatic Emergency Braking, your vehicle may still \napply the brakes after detecting an initial collision to \nreduce further impact (see Multi-Collision Braking  on \npage 127 ). When disabled, the touchscreen displays a \nvisual message.\nAutomatic Emergency Braking is disabled\nWARNING:  It is strongly recommended that you \ndo not disable Automatic Emergency Braking. If \nyou disable it, Model 3  does not automatically \napply the brakes in situations where a collision is \nconsidered likely.\nNOTE:  Automatic Emergency Braking is designed to \nreduce the impact of frontal and reverse collisions with \nlimited functionality while in Reverse.\nIn the event Automatic Emergency Braking is \nunavailable, the touchscreen displays a visual warning.\nAutomatic Emergency Braking is not available\nWARNING:  Automatic Emergency Braking is \ndesigned to reduce the severity of an impact.

It is the driver\u2019s responsibility to drive \nsafely and remain in control of the vehicle at all \ntimes. Never depend on Automatic Emergency \nBraking to avoid or reduce the impact of a \ncollision.\nWARNING:  Automatic Emergency Braking is not a \nsubstitute for maintaining a safe traveling distance \nbetween you and the vehicle in front of you.\nWARNING:  The brake pedal moves downward \nabruptly during automatic braking events. Always \nensure that the brake pedal can move freely. Do \nnot place material under or on top of the driver\u2019s \nfloor  mat (including an additional mat) and always \nensure that the driver\u2019s floor  mat is properly \nsecured.

It is your \nsole responsibility to consult and comply with all local \nregulations and property restrictions regarding the use \nof cameras.\nDashcam records video footage of your vehicle's \nsurroundings when driving Model 3 . Use Dashcam to \nrecord driving incidents or other notable events, like you \nwould for an external dashcam on other vehicles.\nThe Dashcam icon is located in the app launcher. You \ncan add the Dashcam app to the bottom bar for easy \naccess (see Customizing My Apps  on page 6 ). When \nModel 3  is in Park, touching the Dashcam icon displays \nthe Viewer (see Viewing Video Recordings  on page 137 ).\nTo protect your privacy, video recordings are saved \nlocally to a formatted USB flash  drive's onboard \nmemory. Recordings are not sent to Tesla. Model 3  does \nnot record videos when Dashcam is Off.\nHow to Use Dashcam\n1. Format a USB flash  drive. Dashcam requires a \nproperly formatted USB drive inserted in your \nvehicle's USB port (Tesla recommends using the \nglovebox USB port, if equipped) to store and retrieve \nfootage. Vehicles manufactured beginning \napproximately 2020 are equipped with a pre-\nformatted USB flash  drive in the glove box. There are \ntwo ways to format the flash  drive:\n\u25e6 Insert the flash  drive into the USB port and \nnavigate to Controls  > Safety  > Format USB Drive . \nModel 3  automatically formats the flash  drive for \nyou.\n\u25e6 Format the flash  drive on a computer.\nSee USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos  on \npage 137  for more information.\n2. Insert the USB flash  drive into your vehicle's USB \nport, preferably the one in the glovebox.\nNOTE:  For some vehicles manufactured after \napproximately November 1, 2021, the center console \nUSB ports may only support charging devices. Use \nthe USB port inside the glove box for all other \nfunctions.\n3. Enable Dashcam by touching Controls  > Safety  > \nDashcam . Dashcam allows you to choose how and \nwhen footage is saved. You can choose between:\u25e6 Auto : Dashcam automatically saves a recording to \nthe USB drive when Model 3  detects a safety-\ncritical event, such as a collision or airbag \ndeployment. When Auto  is selected, detection can \nvary and is subject to your vehicle's power, sleep, \nand Autopilot state.\nNOTE:  Several factors determine whether \nDashcam automatically saves a recording of a \nsafety-critical event (for example, amount of force, \nwhether or not airbags deploy, etc.). Do not rely \non Dashcam to automatically record all safety-\ncritical events.\n\u25e6 Manual : You must manually touch the Dashcam \nicon to save a recording of the most recent ten \nminutes of footage.\n\u25e6 On Honk : When you press the horn, Dashcam \nsaves a recording of the most recent ten minutes \nof footage. You can enable this along with Auto  or \nManual .\n4. Once enabled, the Dashcam icon indicates when \nfootage is saved. You can also view the status of the \nDashcam icon in Controls :\nThe icon changes to show the status of Dashcam:\nRECORDING : Dashcam is recording. To \nsave video footage, touch the icon. To \npause recording, press and hold the \nicon.\nPAUSED : Dashcam is paused. To resume \nrecording, touch the icon. To avoid \nlosing video footage, pause Dashcam \nbefore removing the flash  drive.\nSAVED : Footage is saved.  You can also \nsave Dashcam clips by touching the \nDashcam icon in the app launcher while \nDriving.\nNOTE:  Once saved, Dashcam saves the last 10 \nminutes of footage.\n5.

It is \nyour sole responsibility to consult and comply with all \nlocal regulations and property restrictions regarding the \nuse of cameras.\nWhen enabled, your vehicle's cameras and sensors (if \nequipped) remain powered on and ready to record \nsuspicious activity around your vehicle when Model 3  is \nlocked and in Park. Think of Sentry Mode as an \nintelligent vehicle security system that alerts you when it \ndetects possible threats nearby.\nIf a threat is detected, Sentry Mode pulses the \nheadlights, sounds the alarm, and displays a message on \nthe touchscreen indicating that the cameras may be \nrecording to inform individuals outside of the vehicle. \nYou will receive an alert on your phone through the \nmobile app and footage of the event is saved to USB \ndrive (if installed).\nSentry Mode is disabled by default. You can use voice \ncommands or the Tesla mobile app to easily enable or \ndisable Sentry Mode. To enable Sentry Mode using voice \ncommands, say \"Keep Tesla safe,\" \"Keep my car safe,\" \n\"Sentry on,\" or \"Enable Sentry\" (see Voice Commands \non page 14 ).\nNOTE:  For some vehicles manufactured after \napproximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB \nports may only support charging devices. Use the USB \nport inside the glove box for all other functions.\nSentry Mode requires your Battery to be at least 20% \ncharged. If the Battery falls below 20%, Sentry Mode \nturns off and the mobile app sends you a notification.  \nPower consumption may increase when Sentry Mode is \nactive.\nNOTE:  When Sentry Mode is enabled, the Security Alarm \nsettings ( Controls  > Safety  > Security Alarm ) are not \navailable.\nCAUTION:  Do not rely on Sentry Mode to protect \nModel 3  from all possible security threats. Sentry \nMode uses many factors to determine whether to \nactivate the security alarm. All impacts may not be \ndetected and the alarm may not activate in all \nsituations. While it may help deter some threats, \nno security system can prevent all attacks.\nHow to Use Sentry Mode (Camera + \nApp)\n1. Sentry Mode requires a properly formatted USB drive \ninserted in your vehicle's USB port (Tesla \nrecommends using the glovebox USB port, if \nequipped) to store and retrieve footage. Vehicles \nmanufactured from approximately 2020 are \nequipped with a pre-formatted USB drive in the glove \nbox. There are two ways to format the USB drive:\u25e6 Insert the USB drive into the USB port and \nnavigate to Controls  > Safety  > Format USB Drive . \nYour vehicle automatically formats the USB drive \nfor you.\n\u25e6 Format the USB drive on a computer\nSee USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos  on \npage 137  for more information.\n2. Insert the USB drive into the vehicle's USB port.\n3. With your vehicle in Park, enable Dashcam by \nnavigating to Controls  > Safety  > Dashcam .\n4. Touch Controls  > Safety  > Sentry Mode  > On. Once \nenabled, the Sentry Mode icon in the Controls  tab \nturns red.\nNOTE:  Rear camera recordings are available only on \nvehicles manufactured after approximately February \n2018.\nWhen enabled, Sentry Mode is idle, ready to sound \nthe alarm and save a recording of the security event \nif triggered. See Viewing Video Recordings  on page \n137 for information on viewing footage.\n5. To silence the security alarm and audio system when \nthe alarm is triggered, navigate to Controls  > Safety  > \nDisable Sentry Sounds . When enabled, Sentry Mode \nstill sends a notification  through the mobile app and \nsaves the last 10 minutes footage.\n6. To manually enable/disable Sentry Mode until the \nnext drive, touch the Sentry Mode icon in Controls . \nSentry Mode is Off when the icon is no longer red.\nTurn Sentry Mode Off in Controls  > Safety  > Sentry \nMode  to disable for more than one drive cycle.\nHow to Use Sentry Mode (App \nOnly)\nWhen Sentry mode is enabled and a security event is \ndetected but without a USB drive plugged into a USB \nport, your vehicle alerts you through the mobile app, \nwithout any camera recordings.\nSentry Mode Settings\n\u2022 Exclude specific  locationsSentry Mode\n135 Dashcam, Sentry, and Security", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28741381-da58-49a4-bfe0-a7f2611433b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "28741381-da58-49a4-bfe0-a7f2611433b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11dafd71-053d-4a75-bee2-02a79e7afc8b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "3a9ec6048c4f24cb5dcf0e25713167942a8b092717ee4c642dc7763e6855a746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8a1d47a-3513-4b9e-9ecb-5279ad95caa2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "9d19d5c34c66f534097ab164ef818a05219a322111f886deb78bfcbba91365dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9144985-7fa4-4ad6-b2ec-55d015b5cfac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "fa55ef3888036a530b939e0770d7699bfa284386373a08d759dd00355a554c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f59a710c1efd1bf41ef857ffcfb1f43229e034e24defb393a3ecc374818a38ca", "text": "In Controls  > Safety  > Sentry Mode , you can \ndetermine if you want Sentry Mode to not enable in \ncertain locations (see Home, Work, and Favorite \nDestinations  on page 150  for more information):\n\u25e6 Exclude Home : Sentry Mode does not \nautomatically enable at the location set as Home \nin your Favorites list.\n\u25e6 Exclude Work : Sentry Mode does not \nautomatically enable at the location set as Work in \nyour Favorites list.\n\u25e6 Exclude Favorites : Sentry Mode does not \nautomatically enable at any location in your \nFavorites list.\nNOTE:  To recognize a location listed as Home, \nWork, or a Favorite, Model 3  must be parked \nwithin approximately 1,640 feet (500 meters)  of \nthe saved location.\nTo set up your Home or Work location, touch \nNavigate  > Set Home/Set Work .

While \nnot necessary to activate whenever you leave Model 3 , \nthe climate control system can reduce and maintain the \ntemperature of your vehicle\u2019s cabin. This can prevent the \ncabin from getting too hot after leaving it parked in the \nsun, making the vehicle more comfortable when you \nreturn. Cabin Overheat Protection may take up to 15 \nminutes to enable once you exit the vehicle. This feature \nis intended for passenger comfort and has no impact on \nthe reliability of your vehicle's components.\nTo turn on, touch Controls  > Safety  > Cabin Overheat \nProtection  and choose:\n\u2022 On: The air conditioning operates when the cabin \ntemperature exceeds 105\u00b0 F (40\u00b0 C) , or the selected \ntemperature if available, on the touchscreen or \nmobile app . Customizing temperatures may require \nthe most recent version of the mobile app.\n\u2022 No A/C : Only the fan operates to prevent touch \nsurfaces from getting too hot.\n\u2022 Off: Disables Cabin Overheat Protection.\nYou can also enable Cabin Overheat Protection remotely \nthrough the mobile app by touching Climate . Swipe up \non the bottom menu and select a setting under Cabin \nOverheat Protection  (see Mobile App  on page 50 ).\nCabin Overheat Protection operates until 12 hours has \nelapsed once you exit Model 3 , or until the Battery \nenergy drops below 20%, whichever comes first. Using \nCabin Overheat Protection requires energy from the \nBattery, which may decrease range.\nNOTE:  To enable Cabin Overheat Protection , Tilt/\nIntrusion  and Sentry Mode  must be turned off.\nWARNING:  Due to automatic shut-off,  extreme \noutside conditions, or other potential inability to \nmaintain the selected temperature, the inside of \nthe vehicle can become dangerously hot, even \nwhen Cabin Overheat Protection is enabled. If you \nexperience temperatures exceeding the selected \ntemperature repeatedly, contact Tesla service.\nWARNING:  Never leave children or pets in the \nvehicle unattended. Due to automatic shut-off  or \nextreme outside conditions, the inside of the \nvehicle can become dangerously hot, even when \nCabin Overheat Protection is enabled.\nClimate Control Operating Tips\n\u2022 When you use the mobile app to turn on the climate \ncontrol system, it automatically turns off when the \ncharge level drops to 20%, or if two hours has passed. \nTo cool or heat the cabin for a longer period of time, \ncharge the vehicle and re-enable your climate control \npreference through the mobile app.\n\u2022 You may hear the sound of the climate system inside \nthe cabin of Model 3  when Parked. It makes a low fan \nnoise. The climate system attempts to dry itself out \nto minimize additional moisture or musty odors. This \nis a normal operation and not a cause for concern.\n\u2022 If your vehicle is equipped with a heat pump (to \ndetermine if your vehicle has a heat pump, touch \nControls  > Software  > Additional Vehicle \nInformation ), you can improve the efficiency  of the \ncabin heating by reducing your selected acceleration \nmode (see Acceleration Modes  on page 79 ). This \nallows the heat pump system to take more heat from \nthe Battery to efficiently  heat the cabin, instead of \nmaintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak \nacceleration performance. This helps to maximize \ndriving efficiency  in colder weather. Note that when \nsubsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the \nBattery requires time to warm up before the \nincreased level of acceleration is available.\n\u2022 Your charge port latch may freeze in extremely cold \nweather or icy conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efb4543a-06b9-477f-9340-8ade4b8d1085": {"__data__": {"id_": "efb4543a-06b9-477f-9340-8ade4b8d1085", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d62beb6a-f4a1-474f-9abd-99af4e5db136", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "d6f83a9922add3bbb06494a24b898c6e55820d2e337b67619afd4cd4386cfaec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe161ae4-eace-4831-abdb-8cec9aa44f25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "44d769cd2af9bf5dd8c4300bf1b2df16d0e08ac045f133abb890854528bc8bed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b8bfc0b-4598-480c-a706-7e499a72b948", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "142", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "62f1bdf4c485c6952131c05c97fbe058a2a5b3e5349f62d9e5b9f51fae292c75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "98d4ab54ff688f27f13544976c8794984fa76443964e59c15eba72eb515b2c66", "text": "This \nis a normal operation and not a cause for concern.\n\u2022 If your vehicle is equipped with a heat pump (to \ndetermine if your vehicle has a heat pump, touch \nControls  > Software  > Additional Vehicle \nInformation ), you can improve the efficiency  of the \ncabin heating by reducing your selected acceleration \nmode (see Acceleration Modes  on page 79 ).

To direct the flow of air in the \nrear cabin area, adjust the vents at the rear of the center \nconsole up, down, or from side to side as necessary.\nCabin Air Filter(s)\nModel 3  has one or more air filters  to prevent pollen, \nindustrial fallout, road dust and other particles from \nentering through the vents.\nNOTE:  Cabin air filter(s)  require periodic replacement. \nSee Service Intervals  on page 174 .Ventilation\n143 Climate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea01796-b0b4-4c7b-8589-44033e55da97": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea01796-b0b4-4c7b-8589-44033e55da97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bbe436b-4d3e-42e8-8139-05e9b3d4708d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "dc30a1286323fccfdf7de890a2b33ce73cd587dc60f2c79b0d1494c2c6d8b936", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cafd75ac-8d0f-4475-bfd6-11c937a4267d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "dc896a1f4453ca305c448c43d6bfc3ab6685f23b07f463480cb362214e5d7ce5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8900109-104f-4b11-9c09-3a419706656f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "cd20e938d9bc97ae97751f37acf544ec67019b50d10f33c368c8f49f3a96a57e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "54d32da3245fedc80be410712b8f1adb30b58cbe10f5b6f06df954daf6ebd0bb", "text": "To ensure that Model 3  provides you with the best \nownership experience possible in harsh cold weather \nconditions, follow these best practices.\nBefore Driving\nWhen snow and ice accumulate on your vehicle, moving \nparts, such as the door handles, windows, mirrors, and \nwipers can freeze in place. To achieve maximum range \nand performance, it is helpful to warm the cabin and \nBattery before you leave. There are several ways to do \nso:\n\u2022 Touch Schedule , available on both the charging and \nclimate control screens, to set a time when you want \nyour vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled \nCharging and Scheduled Departure  on page 169 ).\n\u2022 In the mobile app, navigate to Climate  to customize \nthe temperature at which you want to heat the cabin. \nThis also warms the high voltage Battery as needed.\n\u2022 In the mobile app, navigate to Climate  > Defrost Car \nto melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, \nwindows, and mirrors. This also warms the high \nvoltage Battery as needed.\nNOTE:  Tesla recommends activating climate settings \nat least 30-45 minutes before departure (see \nOperating Climate Controls  on page 138 ). \nPreconditioning times depend on outside \ntemperature and other factors. The mobile app will \nnotify you once your vehicle has reached the desired \npreconditioning temperature.\nCharge Port\n\u2022 If your charge port latch freezes in place and a \ncharging cable becomes stuck in the charge port, try \nmanually releasing the charge cable. See Manually \nReleasing Charge Cable  on page 167 .\n\u2022 In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is \npossible that your charge port latch may freeze in \nplace. Some vehicles are equipped with a charge port \ninlet heater that turns on when you turn on the rear \ndefrost in cold weather conditions. You can also thaw \nice on the charge port latch by enabling Defrost Car \non the mobile app. \nNOTE:  You can also prevent the occurrence of a charge \nport latch freezing in place by using the Schedule \nsettings (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled \nDeparture  on page 169 ).\nNOTE:  If your charge port latch is frozen in place, it may \nnot lock the charging cable in place when inserted, but it \ncan still charge at a slow AC rate even if the latch is not \nengaged.Charging\nBy using Trip Planner (if available in your market region) \nto navigate to a Tesla charging location, Model 3  pre-\nheats the high voltage battery to ensure when you arrive \nat the charger, the temperature of the battery is optimal \nand ready to charge. This reduces the amount of time it \ntakes to charge. See (see Trip Planner  on page 152 ).\nNOTE:  Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate \nto a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before \narrival to ensure optimal battery temperature and \ncharging conditions. If the drive to the charging location \nis less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the \nbattery before driving (see Before Driving  on page 144 ).\nNOTE:  The thermal system may produce steam under \ncertain conditions for vehicles equipped with a heat \npump (to determine if your vehicle has a heat pump, \ntouch Controls  > Software  > Additional Vehicle \nInformation ). For example, odorless steam can come \nfrom the front of your vehicle while charging at a \nSupercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and \nnot a cause for concern.\nWindows\n\u2022 In the mobile app, go to Climate , swipe up from the \nbottom and select Defrost Car , which helps melt \nsnow, ice, and frost on the windshield, windows, and \nmirrors.\n\u2022 In cold temperatures, Model 3  automatically makes a \nslight adjustment to the position of the windows to \nmake it easier to open doors.\nNOTE:  Always connect to an external, low voltage \npower supply before opening a door when the \nvehicle has no power to avoid breaking a window.\n\u2022 Use the mobile app to schedule a service \nappointment for Tesla to provide hydrophobic \ncoating to the side and rear windows (not the front) \nfor a nominal fee.\nDoors\nIn severe winter conditions, ice buildup can make it more \ndifficult  to open door handles. You can use the mobile \napp to pop open the driver door in this situation.\n1. In the mobile app, touch and hold any of the four \nquick control buttons and follow the instructions to \ncustomize quick controls with Unlatch Door .\n2. When you are next to your car, touch Unlatch Door  to \npop open the driver door.Cold Weather Best Practices\n144 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8900109-104f-4b11-9c09-3a419706656f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8900109-104f-4b11-9c09-3a419706656f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f885dd7-9a33-45bd-90f6-c73e9b582aac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "291a52a5ac7af3d33425cda639805d183f3934d7eacbd8aa4ace18339ecd9e28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ea01796-b0b4-4c7b-8589-44033e55da97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "54d32da3245fedc80be410712b8f1adb30b58cbe10f5b6f06df954daf6ebd0bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c878a2cc-85e8-434c-b106-0ae153074be0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "146", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "ce0c302f014927d6c305f830f708d2045da8f07c27e22e0eadc8bc9d94f17bf4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cd20e938d9bc97ae97751f37acf544ec67019b50d10f33c368c8f49f3a96a57e", "text": "Removing Ice From Door Handle\nIn severe winter conditions, ice buildup within the door \nhandle can prevent the door handle from opening.

Check local regulations to \ndetermine if tire chains are recommended or required \nduring winter months. See Using Tire Chains  on page \n181 for more information.\nYour vehicle\u2019s tire pressures will drop in cold ambient \ntemperatures. If the TPMS indicator light appears, inflate  \nthe tires before driving. The tires will lose one PSI for \nevery 10\u00b0 F (6\u00b0 C)  drop in outside temperature (see Tire \nCare and Maintenance  on page 176 ). Proper tire \npressures help protect tires from potholes and improve \nrange when properly inflated.\nWhile Driving\nCold weather can increase energy consumption because \nmore power is required for driving, cabin and Battery \nheating. Follow these suggestions to reduce energy \nconsumption:\n\u2022 Use seat heaters to keep warm. Seat heaters use less \nenergy than the cabin heater. Lowering the cabin \ntemperature and using seat heaters reduces energy \nconsumption (see Operating Climate Controls  on \npage 138 ).\n\u2022 Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid \nacceleration.\n\u2022 If your vehicle is equipped with a heat pump (to \ndetermine if your vehicle has a heat pump, touch \nControls  > Software  > Additional Vehicle \nInformation ), you can improve the efficiency  of the \ncabin heating by reducing your selected acceleration \nmode (see Acceleration Modes  on page 79 ). This \nallows the heat pump system to take more heat from \nthe Battery to efficiently  heat the cabin, instead of \nmaintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak \nacceleration performance. This helps to maximize \ndriving efficiency  in colder weather. Note that when \nsubsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the \nBattery requires time to warm up before the \nincreased level of acceleration is available.\nRegenerative Braking\nRegenerative braking can be limited if the Battery is too \ncold. As you continue to drive, the Battery warms up \nand regenerative power increases (see Regenerative \nBraking  on page 72 ).\nNOTE:  Limited regenerative braking can be avoided if \nyou allow enough time to precondition your vehicle or if \nyou use Schedule  to precondition Model 3  before your \ndeparture time (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled \nDeparture  on page 169 ).\nNOTE:  Installing winter tires can result in temporarily \nreduced regenerative braking power but after a short \nperiod of driving, Model 3  recalibrates to correct this. \nTouch Service  > Wheel & Tire  > Tires  to select winter \ntires and quicken this process.Blue Snowflake  Icon\nA blue snowflake  icon appears on your \ntouchscreen  when some of the stored energy in \nthe Battery is unavailable because the Battery is \ncold. This portion of unavailable energy displays \nin blue on the Battery meter. Regenerative \nbraking, acceleration, and charging rates may be \nlimited. The snowflake  icon no longer displays \nwhen the Battery is sufficiently  warm.\nAfter Driving\nLeave Model 3  plugged in when not in use. This uses the \ncharging system, rather than the battery itself, to keep \nthe battery warm (see High Voltage Battery Information \non page 162 ).\nScheduled Departure\nWhen parked, plug in Model 3  and use the Schedule \nsettings, available on both the charging and climate \ncontrol screens, to set a time when you want to \nprecondition Model 3  (see Scheduled Charging and \nScheduled Departure  on page 169 ). Your vehicle \ndetermines the appropriate time to begin charging so it \nis complete during off-peak  hours and the cabin and \nBattery are warm by your set departure time. For more \ninformation, see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled \nDeparture  on page 169 .\nStorage\nIf you leave Model 3  parked for an extended period of \ntime, plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal \nrange loss and to keep the Battery at an optimal \ntemperature.

In the mobile app, navigate to Climate  to \ncustomize the temperature at which you want to heat \nthe cabin.\n\u2022 In the mobile app, navigate to Controls  to vent the \nwindows.\nNOTE:  Tesla recommends activating climate settings \nat least 30-45 minutes before departure (see \nOperating Climate Controls  on page 138 ). \nPreconditioning times depend on outside \ntemperature and other factors. The mobile app will \nnotify you once your vehicle has reached the desired \npreconditioning temperature.\n\u2022 Enable Cabin Overheat Protection , which prevents \nthe cabin from getting too warm in hot ambient \nconditions. You can choose whether you want the \nA/C or just the fan to run when the temperature in \nthe cabin exceeds 105\u00b0 F (40\u00b0 C) or the selected \ntemperature (if available).\nAfter Driving\nLeave Model 3  plugged in when not in use, especially if \nusing Preconditioning or Cabin Overheat Protection. \nThis uses the charging system, rather than the battery \nitself, to maintain a comfortable temperature (see High \nVoltage Battery Information  on page 162 ). In addition, \nthere are several ways to minimize a hot cabin:\n\u2022 Before leaving your vehicle, use Dog Mode to keep \nthe cabin cool for pets or perishable goods. See Keep \nClimate On, Dog, and Camp  on page 140  for more \ninformation.\n\u2022 Tesla recommends turning the air conditioning off \napproximately 30 seconds before pressing Park to \nreduce puddling below the vehicle.\n\u2022 Park in the shade to help reduce power consumption \nand maintain cooler cabin temperatures.\n\u2022 Use a sun shade (which are available for purchase on \nthe Tesla Shop) if you have to park outside in the sun.\u2022 When parked, plug in Model 3  and Schedule  your \ncharging. Your vehicle determines the appropriate \ntime to begin charging so it is complete during off-\npeak  hours. The cabin and Battery are also prepared \nby your set departure time. For more information, see \nScheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure  on \npage 169 .\nCharging\nWhen using Trip Planner or navigating to a Supercharger \nstation, your vehicle automatically prepares the Battery \nfor most efficient  charging. In extreme heat, you may not \nsee the message that the vehicle is preconditioning the \nBattery while navigating to a Supercharger, but it is still \npreparing the Battery for charging.\nNOTE:  Tesla recommends using Trip Planner to navigate \nto a charging location for at least 30-45 minutes before \narrival to ensure optimal battery temperature and \ncharging conditions. If the drive to the charging location \nis less than 30-45 minutes, consider preconditioning the \nbattery before driving (see Before Driving  on page 144 ).\nIf possible, leave your vehicle plugged into a charger \nwhenever not in use, even in warm weather, especially if \nusing preconditioning or cabin overheat protection.\nStorage\nIf you leave Model 3  parked for an extended period of \ntime, plug the vehicle into a charger to prevent normal \nrange loss and to keep the Battery at an optimal \ntemperature.

You can \nalso add a stop by touching any pin on the \nmap and selecting Add from the popup.\nEdit Stop  allows you to set up a complex \ntrip by adding or deleting stops on your \nroute. Drag and drop stops by touching the \nequal sign to reorder your trip.\nAutomatic Navigation\nNOTE:  Automatic Navigation may not be available in all \nmarket regions and on all vehicle configurations.Automatic Navigation can predict a destination when \nyou get in your vehicle. When your phone's calendar is \nsynced to Model 3 , and the calendar includes an event \nthat takes place within two hours of when you get in \nyour vehicle to drive, Automatic Navigation suggests the \nlocation of the event (assuming a valid address is \nassociated with the event).\nIn addition, if you are Home and get in your vehicle on \nweekdays (Monday to Friday) from 5:00 AM to 11:00 AM, \nAutomatic Navigation can automatically route you to \nyour specified  Work location (see Home, Work, and \nFavorite Destinations  on page 150 ). Likewise, if you are \nat work on weekdays from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM, \nAutomatic Navigation can automatically route you to \nyour specified  Home location.\nTo enable Automatic Navigation, touch Controls  > \nNavigation  > Automatic Navigation . You must have your \nphone's calendar synced to Model 3  and the event must \ninclude a uniquely specified  and valid address (see \nPhone, Calendar, and Web Conferencing  on page 55 ).\nNOTE:  Navigation instructions that you enter manually, \nor send to Model 3 , override routes suggested by \nAutomatic Navigation.\nLucky and Hungry\nNOTE:  \"Lucky\" and \"Hungry\" may not be available in all \nmarket regions and on all vehicle configurations.\nIn addition to navigating to a destination of your choice, \nModel 3  can also suggest nearby locations based on \nwhether you are feeling Hungry  or Lucky . In the \nnavigation search bar, touch Hungry  or Lucky . Hungry \nsuggests a list of popular restaurants, whereas Lucky \nsuggests a list of popular destinations (such as \nmuseums and amusement parks). Once you discover a \ndestination that interests you, touch Navigate  to \nproceed to the destination.\nThis feature requires the latest version of Navigation \nmaps. To download, connect Model 3  to Wi-Fi and touch \nControls  > Software  to check if an update is available \n(see Map Updates  on page 153 ).\nHome, Work, and Favorite \nDestinations\nIf you frequently drive to a destination, you can add it as \na favorite to avoid entering the location's name or \naddress each time. When you add a destination as a \nFavorite, you can easily navigate to it by touching the \nnavigation search bar and then touching Favorites  and \nchoosing it from your list of favorite destinations.Maps and Navigation\n150 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "254c35a7-ffc7-4152-ac1e-e09f51b275d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "254c35a7-ffc7-4152-ac1e-e09f51b275d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7d2ba7d-3e22-443a-b3ea-a064b4f11852", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "151", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "39f7bdfc50980a2f8f3ba8fe786da337eec476c50ddbd4bd18d17ae9d095e07c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d94d1601-8621-48b2-81b1-b3c51e00cdf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "125195e75d8135b6ac4b7973e4ad4a36eb220291c76184e4f20e5849bc83fb9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d738a5d-7e98-47f5-90ff-660b3030cfb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "2ce44424950add93ac03e7b68cdeb350e2f05cebdd153d8457b9890b225cb92d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "317de22c98d19a5b7db368fa5adeb7fed9239883eda1300b09901c6a5c9ea2d2", "text": "To add a destination to your Favorites list \ntouch its pin on the map, then touch the \nstar icon on the popup screen that \nappears.

When the turn-by-turn direction list is compressed, \ntouch the top of the list to expand it.\nThe calculation that predicts how much energy you will \nuse is an estimate based on driving style (predicted \nspeed, etc.) and environmental factors (elevation \nchanges, wind speed and direction, ambient and \nforecasted temperatures, air density and humidity, etc.). \nAs you drive, Model 3  continuously learns how much \nenergy it uses, resulting in improved accuracy over time. \nIt is important to note that Model 3  predicts energy \nusage based on the driving style of the individual \nvehicle. For example, if you drive aggressively for a \nperiod of time, future range predictions will assume \nhigher consumption. Also, if you purchase a used Tesla \nvehicle, it is recommended that you perform a factory \nreset ( Controls  > Service  > Factory Reset ) to ensure the \npredicted energy is as accurate as possible.\nThroughout your route, Model 3  monitors energy usage \nand updates the estimate of energy remaining at the \nend of your trip. A popup warning displays on the turn-\nby-turn direction list in these situations:\nNOTE:  Some factors that contribute to predicted energy \n(such as forecasted temperatures and wind speed) are \navailable only when Model 3  has internet connectivity.\u2022 A yellow warning displays when you have very little \nenergy remaining to reach your destination, requiring \nyou to drive slowly to conserve energy. For tips on \nconserving energy, see Getting Maximum Range  on \npage 170 .\n\u2022 A red warning displays when you must charge to \nreach your destination.\nTo determine if you have enough energy for a round trip, \ntouch the Battery icon on the turn-by-turn direction list \nto display an estimated calculation of your round trip \nenergy usage.\nOnline Routing\nModel 3  detects real-time traffic  conditions and \nautomatically adjusts the estimated driving and arrival \ntimes. In situations where traffic  conditions will delay \nyour estimated time of arrival and an alternate route is \navailable, the navigation system can reroute you to your \ndestination.

The most important way to \npreserve the high voltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR \nVEHICLE PLUGGED IN  when you are not using it. This is \nparticularly important if you are not planning to drive \nModel 3  for several weeks.\nNOTE:  When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle \nperiodically uses energy from the Battery for system \ntests and recharging the low voltage  battery when \nnecessary.\nThere is no advantage to waiting until the Battery\u2019s level \nis low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best \nwhen charged regularly.\nNOTE:  If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other \ncomponents may become damaged or require \nreplacement (for example, the low voltage  battery). In \nthese cases, you are responsible for repair and/or \ntransporting expenses. Discharge-related expenses are \nnot covered by the warranty or under the Roadside \nAssistance policy.\nThe peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease \nslightly after a large number of DC Fast Charging \nsessions, such as those at Superchargers. To ensure \nmaximum driving range and Battery safety, the Battery \ncharge rate is decreased when the Battery is too cold, \nwhen the Battery\u2019s charge is nearly full, and when the \nBattery conditions change with usage and age. These \nchanges in the condition of the Battery are driven by \nbattery physics and may increase the total \nSupercharging duration by a few minutes over time. You \ncan minimize the amount of charge time by using Trip \nPlanner (if available in your market region) to warm the \nBattery while driving to a Supercharger. See Trip Planner \non page 152  for more information.\nBattery Care\nNever allow the Battery to fully discharge. Even when \nModel 3  is not being driven, its Battery discharges very \nslowly to power the onboard electronics. The Battery \ncan discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, \nthough the discharge rate may vary depending on \nenvironmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle \nconfiguration,  and your selected settings on the \ntouchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must \nleave Model 3  unplugged for an extended period of time \n(for example, at an airport when traveling). In these \nsituations, keep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave \nthe Battery with a sufficient  charge level. For example, \nover a two week period (14 days), the Battery may \ndischarge by approximately 14%.\nDischarging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to \nvehicle components. To protect against a complete \ndischarge, Model 3  enters a low-power consumption \nmode when the displayed charge level drops to \napproximately 0%. In this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard electronics and auxiliary low \nvoltage  battery. Once this low-power consumption \nmode is active, immediately plug in Model 3  to prevent a \njump start and low voltage  battery replacement.\nNOTE:  If Model 3  is unresponsive and does not unlock, \nopen, or charge, the low voltage  battery may be \ndischarged. In this situation, try jump starting the low \nvoltage  battery (see Jump Starting  on page 225 ).

See Trip Planner  on \npage 152 ).\nSupercharger Usage Fees and Idle \nFees\nWhen charging at a Tesla supercharger, information \nabout the charging session displays at the bottom of the \ncharging screen. This includes the location, the time that \ncharging started, and a cost estimate for the session. \nWhen you stop supercharging, the estimated cost of the \nsession displays until a new supercharging session \nbegins.NOTE:  Estimated cost may not reflect  the final cost of \nthe supercharging session. Final pricing for \nsupercharging sessions can be found in your Tesla \naccount.\nWhen charging at a Tesla supercharger, you are subject \nto idle fees. Idle fees are designed to encourage drivers \nto move their vehicle from the Supercharger when \ncharging is complete. Idle fees are in effect  only when \nhalf or more of the Superchargers at a site are occupied. \nThe Tesla mobile app notifies  you when charging is \nalmost complete, and again when charging is complete. \nAdditional notifications  are sent if idle fees are incurred. \nIdle fees are waived if you move your vehicle within five \nminutes of when charging completed.\nLog into your Tesla account to view fees and details \nabout Supercharger sessions, set up a payment method, \nand make payments. Once a payment method is saved, \nfees are automatically paid from your account.\nCharging Best Practices\n\u2022 Avoid allowing the Battery to get too low (the \nBattery icon turns yellow when the capacity \nremaining in the Battery drops to 20% or below).\n\u2022 Refer to the information on the vehicle touchscreen \n(navigate to Controls  > Charging ) or the mobile App \n(touch the Charging  icon) for recommended daily \nand trip charging limits.\nManually Releasing Charge Cable\nIf the usual methods for releasing a charge cable from \nthe charge port (using the charge handle release button, \ntouchscreen, or mobile app) do not work, try pressing \nand holding down the rear trunk button on the key fob \naccessory  (if equipped)  for 1-2 seconds.

However, if Model 3  is plugged in \nafter six hours of the scheduled charging time, charging \nmay not start until the scheduled time on the next day.\nUsing Scheduled Departure\nUse Scheduled Departure  to set a daily time when you \nwant Model 3  to be ready to drive. Model 3 \nautomatically calculates when it needs to start \npreconditioning and/or charging. This ensures that \ncharging is complete and/or the cabin climate and \nBattery are preconditioned by your departure time.\nWhen Scheduled Departure  is displayed, touch \nSchedule  to set a daily time when you want Model 3  to \nbe ready to drive.

For example, if \ncharging starts as soon as you plug in, charging may \ncomplete much sooner. This causes the Battery to \ncool down to ambient temperatures and requires \nenergy to warm it back up by your departure time. \nTherefore, even if off-peak  utility rates are not \napplicable to you, it is recommended that you set \nOff-Peak  Hours to the same time as your departure \ntime in order to reduce energy consumption.\nNOTE:  If there is not enough time to reach the charge \nlimit, charging starts immediately in order to charge \nas much as possible.\nNOTE:  Once charging has started and there is not \nenough time to complete charging during off-peak \nhours, charging continues until the charge limit is \nreached.\nYou can limit Preconditioning  and Off-Peak  Charging  to \nweekdays only.Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure\n169 Charging and Energy Consumption", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1b2d95a-90cc-4924-9a80-e32e71f0d600": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1b2d95a-90cc-4924-9a80-e32e71f0d600", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "578ff16c-790d-459c-b7b0-fbf3b98c1d7c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "9b237d8fdd7e11333d3d58e4b1e2476329b19915c877e63280abc22da1586488", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "df898b75-5094-4533-90d3-2e49b0494b5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "8a6f9f229209f20e790f32a260c6fd9128ef5a826f9b2c7bbdb4910e6a824edd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb636c14-65a0-4377-9784-19906e945309", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f888fbfed359de74388a33320bcdd87c78e3210d5aa785b27436540b71575790", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "275a764622a6d4ec3e11c05a843b6666fda4e8a9226c43f62a74011d1c733f06", "text": "Factors Affecting  Energy \nConsumption\nWhile driving:\n\u2022 Elevated driving speed.\n\u2022 Environmental conditions such as cold or hot weather \nand wind.\n\u2022 Using climate controls to heat or cool the cabin.\n\u2022 Uphill travel: Driving uphill requires more energy and \ndepletes range at a faster rate. However, driving \ndownhill allows your vehicle to regain a portion of its \nexpended energy through regenerative braking (see \nRegenerative Braking  on page 72 ).\n\u2022 Short trips or stop-and-go traffic:  It takes energy to \nbring the cabin and Battery to a specified \ntemperature when starting the vehicle. You may see a \nhigher average consumption when the vehicle is used \nfor very short trips or in heavy traffic.\n\u2022 Heavy cargo load.\n\u2022 Windows rolled down.\n\u2022 Wheels and tires not maintained.\n\u2022 Customized settings or third-party accessories (roof \nor trunk racks, third-party wheels).\nWhile parked and not plugged in to a charger: \n\u2022 Preconditioning the cabin or using climate controls.\n\u2022 Summon.\n\u2022 Vehicle infotainment and climate controls system.\n\u2022 Sentry mode.\n\u2022 Tesla or third-party mobile app requests.\nTips to Maximize Range\nYou can maximize your driving range using the same \ndriving habits you use to conserve fuel in a gasoline-\npowered vehicle. To achieve maximum range:\n\u2022 Slow down your driving and avoid frequent and rapid \nacceleration. Consider using Chill Mode (touch \nControls  > Pedals & Steering  > Acceleration ) and \nSpeed Assist (see Speed Assist  on page 129 ) to assist \nin controlling your acceleration and speed.\n\u2022 If safe to do so, modulate the accelerator pedal \ninstead of using the brake pedal when gradually \nslowing down. Whenever Model 3  is moving and you \nare not pressing the accelerator pedal, regenerative \nbraking slows down the vehicle and feeds surplus \nenergy back to the Battery (see Regenerative Braking \non page 72 ).\u2022 Limit the use of resources such as heating and air \nconditioning. Using seat and steering wheel  heaters \n(if equipped) to keep warm is more efficient  than \nheating the cabin using climate controls.\n\u2022 With your vehicle plugged in, use the mobile app to \nprecondition your vehicle to ensure the cabin is at a \ncomfortable temperature and windows are defrosted \n(if needed) before your drive by touching Climate  > \nOn and customizing your preferences (see Mobile \nApp on page 50 ).\n\u2022 Touch Schedule , available on both the charging and \nclimate control screens, to set a time when you want \nyour vehicle to be ready to drive (see Scheduled \nCharging and Scheduled Departure  on page 169 ).\n\u2022 Set Stopping Mode to Hold  to gain the benefit  of \nregenerative braking at low driving speeds (see \n#unique_273  on page ).\n\u2022 Ensure the wheels are aligned to specification,  the \ntires are kept at the recommended inflation  pressures \n(see Tire Care and Maintenance  on page 176 ), and are \nrotated when needed (see Maintenance Service \nIntervals  on page 174 ).\n\u2022 Install aero covers (if equipped) to reduce wind \nresistance (see Removing and Installing Aero Covers \non page 178 ).\n\u2022 Lighten your load by removing any unnecessary \ncargo.\n\u2022 Fully raise all windows.\n\u2022 Features such as Sentry Mode and Cabin Overheat \nProtection can impact range. Disable features when \nnot needed.\n\u2022 To prevent an excessive amount of energy \nconsumption while the vehicle is idle, keep the \nvehicle plugged in when not in use.\nIt is normal for estimated range to decrease slightly over \nthe first few months before leveling off. Over time, you \nmay see a gradual, but natural, decrease in range at full \ncharge \u2013 this depends on factors such as the mileage \nand age of the Battery. Your Model 3  will inform you in \nthe unlikely event a hardware issue is causing excessive \nBattery or range degradation.\nThe power meter on the touchscreen  provides feedback \non energy usage.\nRange Assurance\nThe driving range displayed in Model 3  is an estimate of \nthe remaining battery energy based on EPA-rated \nconsumption. It may not account for your personal \ndriving patterns or external conditions. The displayed \nrange on the touchscreen  may decrease faster than the \nactual distance driven.

Tesla recommends \nyou install software updates at the earliest opportunity \non your vehicle. To ensure the fastest and most reliable \ndelivery of software updates, leave Wi-Fi turned on and \nconnected whenever possible. In most cases, your \nvehicle must be connected to Wi-Fi to start an update \n(see Wi-Fi  on page 52 ).\nSoftware updates are not performed when the following \nfeatures are active:\n\u2022 Keep Climate On, Dog Mode, or Camp Mode\n\u2022 Sentry Mode\nNOTE:  On an as-needed basis, Tesla also sends software \nupdates using a cellular connection.\nWARNING:  Do not attempt to use the vehicle while \nthe software is being updated. Vehicle functions, \nincluding some safety systems and opening or \nclosing the doors or windows, may be limited or \ndisabled when a software update is in progress \nand you could damage the vehicle.\nWhen a software update is available, a yellow clock icon \nappears at the top of the Controls  screen . There are \nthree ways you can install software updates:\n\u2022 Touch the yellow clock icon to display the scheduling \nscreen, which prompts you to select a time to install \nthe update ( Set For This Time ) or install it now \n(Install Now ). Once scheduled, the yellow clock icon \nchanges to a white clock icon until the update begins. \nAt any time before the update begins, you can touch \nthis clock icon to reschedule the update.\n\u2022 Touch Controls  > Software  to determine if an update \nis available for your vehicle. If available, touch \nSoftware Update Available  to navigate to the \nscheduling screen, as mentioned above.\n\u2022 Start updates using the Tesla mobile app.\nNOTE:  Some software updates can take up to three \nhours to complete. Model 3  must be in Park while the \nsoftware is being updated. To ensure the fastest and \nmost reliable delivery of software updates, leave the Wi-\nFi turned on and connected whenever possible (see Wi-\nFi on page 52 ).\nThere are two phases to a software update:\n\u2022 Download phase : During this phase, the new update \nis sent wirelessly to the vehicle. If a software update \nis available but cannot be downloaded because the \nvehicle is not connected to Wi-Fi, the top of the \ntouchscreen displays a yellow download icon. The \nnext time the vehicle connects to Wi-Fi, the \ndownload occurs automatically. When the download \nis in progress, the download icon turns green. \nAlthough you can drive while the software update is downloaded, doing so can interrupt the download if \nyour vehicle loses the Wi-Fi connection. When the \nsoftware update is fully downloaded and ready to \ninstall, a yellow clock icon displays at the top of the \ntouchscreen.\n\u2022 Install phase : During the install phase, you cannot \ndrive. If plugged in, your vehicle will stop charging \nuntil the installation is complete. To start the install \nphase, touch the yellow clock icon at the top of the \ntouchscreen. Touch Install Now  to begin the \ninstallation immediately or touch Set For This Time  to \nchoose a start time for the installation. If you \nschedule the software update to install at a future \ntime, the yellow clock icon changes to a white clock \nicon until the installation begins. At any time before \nthe update installs, you can touch this clock icon to \nreschedule.\nNOTE:  Software updates will not install if Keep, Dog, or \nCamp mode are enabled (see Keep Climate On, Dog, \nand Camp  on page 140 ).\nSoftware Update Preferences\nTesla determines how, when, and where to send updates \nto vehicles based on various factors unique to each \nrelease. You can choose how quickly and often you \nreceive software updates. To change your preference, \ntouch Controls  > Software  > Software Update \nPreferences  and choose either of these options:\n\u2022 Standard : Receive software updates using the normal \nrollout timeframe for your region and vehicle \nconfiguration.  When a software release is made \navailable it has generally been running on other \ncustomer vehicles for a period of time.\n\u2022 Advanced : Receive the latest software updates for \nyour region and vehicle configuration  at the earliest \nopportunity they are available. Keep in mind that \nalthough you receive updates at the earliest \nopportunity, you may not be in the first group of \nTesla owners to receive the update. Choosing \nAdvanced does not enroll your vehicle in Tesla's early \naccess program.\nNOTE:  Tesla does not update software upon request for \nthose wanting to receive the latest features and \nimprovements.

The pressure of each tire displays in the \nvisualization of your Model 3 , in addition to what time \nyour tire pressures were last measured. The touchscreen \nalso displays your vehicle's recommended cold tire \npressures so you can easily determine how much to \ninflate  your tires. You can choose whether you want to \ndisplay tire pressures using Bar or PSI by touching \nControls  > Display  > Tire Pressure .\nYou can also view tire pressures in the Tesla mobile app.\nNOTE:  You may need to drive briefly  before the \nvisualization displays the tire pressure values.\nMaintaining Tire Pressures\nKeep tires inflated  to the pressures shown on the Tire \nand Loading Information label, even if it differs  from the \npressure printed on the tire itself. The Tire and Loading \nInformation label is located on the center door pillar and \nis visible when the driver door is open.\nNOTE:  If your Model 3  is fitted  with Tesla accessory \nwheels or tires, some information may be different  from \nthe labels on the vehicle.  See Accessory Wheels and \nTires  on page 190 .\nThe Tire Pressure indicator light on the \ntouchscreen  alerts you if one or more tires \nis under-  or over- inflated.The Tire Pressure indicator light does not immediately \nturn off when you adjust tire pressure. After inflating  the \ntire to the recommended pressure, you must drive over \n15 mph (25 km/h) for a short amount of time to activate \nthe Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), which turns \noff the Tire Pressure indicator light.\nIf the indicator light flashes  for one minute whenever \nyou power on Model 3 , a fault with the TPMS is detected \n(see TPMS Malfunction  on page 181 ).\nNOTE:  Your vehicle\u2019s tire pressures will drop in cold \nambient temperatures. If the TPMS indicator light \nappears, inflate  the tires before driving. The tires will \nlose one PSI for every 10\u00b0 F (6\u00b0 C)  drop in outside \ntemperature. Proper tire pressures help protect tires \nfrom potholes and improve range when properly \ninflated.\nWARNING:  Under-inflation  is the most common \ncause of tire failures and can cause a tire to \noverheat, resulting in severe tire cracking, tread \nseparation, or blowout, resulting in unexpected \nloss of vehicle control and increased risk of injury. \nUnder-inflation  also reduces the vehicle's range \nand tire tread life.\nWARNING:  Check tire pressures using an accurate \npressure gauge when tires are cold. It takes only \nabout one mile (1.6 km)  of driving to warm up the \ntires sufficiently  to affect  tire pressures. Parking \nthe vehicle in direct sunlight or in hot weather can \nalso affect  tire pressures. If you must check warm \ntires, expect increased pressures. Do not let air out \nof warm tires in an attempt to match \nrecommended cold tire pressures. A hot tire at or \nbelow the recommended cold tire inflation \npressure is dangerously under-inflated.\nChecking and Adjusting Tire Pressures\nFollow these steps when tires are cold and Model 3  has \nbeen stationary for over three hours:\n1. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label \nlocated on the driver\u2019s center door pillar for the \ntarget tire pressure.\n2. Remove the valve cap.\n3. Firmly press an accurate tire pressure gauge onto the \nvalve to measure pressure.\n4. If required, add or remove air to reach the \nrecommended pressure.\nNOTE:  You can release air by pressing the metal stem \nin the center of the valve.\n5. Re-check pressure using the accurate tire gauge.\n6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary until the tire \npressure is correct.\n7. Reinstall the valve cap to prevent dirt from entering. \nPeriodically check the valve for damage and leaks.Tire Care and Maintenance\n176 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a5691bf-2c24-4dae-8a1f-b95e3602009e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a5691bf-2c24-4dae-8a1f-b95e3602009e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df47da57-3a2c-4375-bd2a-d421b2735422", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "1122b64ae7651101b34c60d4c39394a54944ef0322509770cdc55b472fc8b6c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2d40d6d-bfd5-41fc-bf3a-1b609f8f9e2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "7920c89c1764efc7d66f0cee156066c6df5ac895f8ab72cb71d4498614f46400", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e8658a2-694c-4af5-8690-df58c7a07f4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "b0d2f2c02a6e0cc37e023540b96db41bbb98ca102fe089a3dc97a9bb3d0ef521", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "71144e50d8ee5e559452cb6b5ce85463d152892ef54c1a70051a57c74e7b924a", "text": "Inspecting and Maintaining Tires\nRegularly inspect the tread and side walls for any sign of \ndistortion (bulges), foreign objects, cuts or wear.\nWARNING:  Do not drive Model 3  if a tire is \ndamaged, excessively worn, or inflated  to an \nincorrect pressure. Check tires regularly for wear, \nand ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure \nof the ply/cord structure.\nTire Wear\nAdequate tread depth is important for proper tire \nperformance. Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32\u201d \n(3 mm)  are more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions \nand should not be used. Tires with a tread depth less \nthan 5/32\u201d (4 mm)  do not perform well in snow and \nslush and should not be used when driving in winter \nconditions.\nModel 3  is originally fitted  with tires that have wear \nindicators molded into the tread pattern. When the \ntread has been worn down to 4/32\u201d (3 mm) , the \nindicators start to appear at the surface of the tread \npattern, producing the effect  of a continuous band of \nrubber across the width of the tire. For optimal \nperformance and safety, Tesla recommends replacing \ntires before the wear indicators are visible.\nTo improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize \nhydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most \ntread on the rear of the car.\nTire Rotation, Balance, and Wheel \nAlignment\nTesla recommends rotating the tires every 6,250 miles \n(10,000 km)  or if tread depth difference  is 2/32 in (1.5 \nmm)  or greater, whichever comes first.\nTire rotation is an essential part of tire maintenance. It \nhelps maintain an even treadwear pattern which \nenhances the tire's overall wear quality, decreases road \nnoise and maximizes tire life.\nUnbalanced wheels (sometimes noticeable as vibration \nthrough the steering wheel ) affect  vehicle handling and \ntire life. Even with regular use, wheels can get out of \nbalance. Therefore, they should be balanced as required.\nIf tire wear is uneven (on one side of the tire only) or \nbecomes abnormally excessive, check the wheel \nalignment.  If the tires need to be serviced, such as \nrotated or replaced, reset the tire configuration  (see Tire \nConfiguration  on page 180 ) to improve your driving \nexperience.Punctured Tires\nA puncture eventually causes the tire to lose pressure, \nwhich is why it is important to check tire pressures \nfrequently. Permanently repair or replace punctured or \ndamaged tires as soon as possible.\nYour tubeless tires may not leak when penetrated, \nprovided the object remains in the tire. If, however, you \nfeel a sudden vibration or ride disturbance while driving, \nor you suspect a tire is damaged, immediately reduce \nyour speed. Drive slowly, while avoiding heavy braking \nor sharp steering and, when safe to do so, stop the \nvehicle. Arrange to have Model 3  transported to a Tesla \nService Center, or to a nearby tire repair center.\nNOTE:  In some cases, you can temporarily repair small \ntire punctures (under 1/4\u201d (6 mm) ) using an optional tire \nrepair kit available from Tesla. This allows you to slowly \ndrive Model 3  to Tesla or to a nearby tire repair facility.\nWARNING:  Do not drive with a punctured tire that \nhas not been repaired, even if the puncture has not \ncaused the tire to deflate.  A punctured tire can \ndeflate  suddenly at any time.\nFlat Spots\nIf Model 3  is stationary for a long period, tires can form \nflat spots.

Choose a Tesla-approved tire which is \ndesigned specifically  for your vehicle. Most Tesla-\napproved tires can be identified  with a T x specification  \n(for example, T0, T1, T2). Tesla-approved tires are \ndesigned to reduce road noise and optimize handling, \nride, and range. Contact Tesla Service for information.\nIf tires need to be replaced early, for example due to a \nflat tire, we recommend replacing the tires in pairs \nunless the other tires are within 2/32 in (1.5 mm)  of tread \ndepth of the new tire. When replacing tires, it is \nimportant to match the brand and model of the older \ntires. Always place a pair of new tires on the rear if all \nfour tires are the same size. Always balance the wheel \nand tire after replacing a tire. Consult with a professional \ntire retailer and installer for further guidance.  If you \nreplace your tires or install different  ones, reset the tire \nconfiguration  (see Tire Configuration  on page 180 ). This \nresets the learned tire settings and improves the driving \nexperience on your new tires.  It may take up to 24 hours \nafter a tire replacement or repair before the tire \nlubricant is completely dry and tires achieve maximum \nadherence to the rims. Avoid hard accelerations during \nthis period to avoid tire slip on the rim\nNOTE:  Regardless of the number of tires replaced, a \ncomplete set of matching tires is recommended for \noptimum performance.\nIf tires other than those specified  are used, ensure that \nthe load and speed ratings marked on the tire (see \nUnderstanding Tire Markings  on page 214 ) equal or \nexceed those of the original specification.\nFor the specification  of the original wheels and tires \ninstalled on Model 3 , see Wheels and Tires  on page 213 .\nIf you replace a wheel, the TPMS (Tire Pressure \nMonitoring System) sensors need to be reset to ensure \nthey provide accurate warnings when tires are under-  or \nover- inflated  \n (see Automatic Reset of TPMS Sensors  on page 180 ).\nNOTE:  Installing winter tires with aggressive compound \nand tread design may result in temporarily-reduced \nregenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is \ndesigned to continuously recalibrate itself, and after \nchanging tires it will increasingly restore regenerative \nbraking power after some moderate-torque straight-line \naccelerations. For most drivers this occurs after a short \nperiod of normal driving, but drivers who normally \naccelerate lightly may need to use slightly harder \naccelerations while the recalibration is in progress. Go to \nService  > Wheel & Tire  > Tires  to select winter tires and \nquicken this process.\nWARNING:  For your safety, use only tires and \nwheels that match the original specification.  Tires \nthat do not match the original specification  can \naffect  the operation of the TPMS.\nWARNING:  Never exceed the speed rating of your \nvehicle's tires. The speed rating is shown on the \nsidewall of your tires  (see Understanding Tire \nMarkings  on page 214 ).\nAsymmetric Tires\nModel 3  tires are asymmetric and must be mounted on \nthe wheel with the correct sidewall facing outward. The \nsidewall of the tire is marked with the word OUTSIDE . \nWhen new tires are installed, make sure that the tires are \ncorrectly mounted on the wheels.\nWARNING:  Road holding is seriously impaired if \nthe tires are incorrectly installed on the wheels.\nRemoving and Installing Aero Covers\nIf your Model 3  is equipped with aero covers, you must \nremove them to access the lug nuts.\nTo remove an aero cover:\n1. Grasp the aero cover firmly  with both hands.\n2. Pull the aero cover toward you to release the \nretaining clips.\nTo install an aero cover:\n1. Align the aero cover with the valve stem.\n2. Firmly press the center of the cover to secure it in \nplace, then work your way out to firmly  pressing the \nouter perimeter of each spoke. You may need to hold \nonto the opposite side of the cover until all spokes \nare secured.Tire Care and Maintenance\n178 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da44b912-0503-42ab-9547-caf71b135d2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "da44b912-0503-42ab-9547-caf71b135d2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f10fd15-8ac2-47f0-bfe4-11b6dec30d4c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "d1a85d7efb881153e3599d1131fa24dc4e9ed362a822e76dbeddfc4d7940b7ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cd26784-f97e-4d6e-a010-a958c0ad7e0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "86b652db6af89ca3925bf8b821032be0b98c9140b674b64100b1292a180bd86b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b6b6f91-7fdf-4e44-8cd9-668a1701d960", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "9c88ab990bca0c708e208ba36fa434de845edc2b3025a93d79eccb19d78865d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ca32fbcc0622ee9912a6a47eb2ac836c7a6d3156755929bfb79f49b743734721", "text": "3.

This allows Model 3  to learn the new wheels and \nprovide more accurate status updates on your vehicle. \nSelect a wheel from the drop down menu that matches \nthe new wheels you plan to install on Model 3 . Selecting \nnew wheels in the wheel configuration  also changes the \nwheels that appear on your vehicle's avatar on the \ntouchscreen.\nNOTE:  Changing your vehicle's wheel configuration  can \nimpact range estimates, tire pressure warning levels, and \nvehicle visualization.\nWARNING:  Only use Tesla-approved wheels when \ninstalling or swapping wheels. Using non Tesla-\napproved wheels can cause serious damage. Tesla \nis not liable for damage caused by using wheels \nnot approved by Tesla.\nTire Configuration\nTo see the miles driven since your last tire rotation or \nreplacement, touch Controls  > Service  and look under \nLast Tire Service. After the tires on Model 3  are rotated, \nreplaced, or swapped, update your vehicle's tire \nconfiguration  by touching Reset , or by touching Wheel \n& Tire  > Tires  from the same screen. This allows your \nvehicle to reset the learned tire settings and improve \nyour driving experience.  \u202fThis also clears and resets the \ntread wear alert for the vehicle until you travel 6,250 \nmiles and low tread depth is detected again.\nEnsure you are aware if your vehicle is equipped with \nwinter tires. Winter tires can be identified  by a mountain \nand snowflake  icon on the tires' sidewall. See Winter \nTires  on page 181  for more information.\nNOTE:  Changing your vehicle's tire configuration  can \ntemporarily impact acceleration and regenerative \nbraking levels and should only be done after tires have \nbeen rotated or replaced.\nTire Pressure Monitoring\nEach tire should be checked monthly when cold and \ninflated  to the recommended pressures that are printed \non the Tire and Loading Information label located on the \ndriver\u2019s  door pillar (see Maintaining Tire Pressures  on \npage 176 ). If your vehicle has tires of a different  size than \nthe size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation \npressure label, determine the proper tire inflation \npressure for those tires.\nAs an added safety feature, your vehicle has been \nequipped with a TPMS that displays a tire pressure \ntelltale (Tire Pressure Warning) on the touchscreen  when \none or more of your tires is significantly  under-  or over-\ninflated.  Accordingly, when the Tire Pressure indicator \nlight displays on the touchscreen  to alert you about tire pressure, stop and check your tires as soon as possible, \nand inflate  them to the proper pressure (see Maintaining \nTire Pressures  on page 176 ). Driving on a significantly \nunder-inflated  tire causes the tire to overheat and can \nlead to tire failure. Under-inflation  also reduces range \nefficiency  and tire tread life, and may affect  the vehicle's \nhandling and stopping ability.\nIf Model 3  detects a fault with the TPMS, \nthis indicator flashes  for one minute \nwhenever you power on Model 3 .\nNOTE:  Installing accessories that are not approved by \nTesla can interfere with the TPMS.\nWARNING:  The TPMS is not a substitute for proper \ntire maintenance, including manually checking tire \npressures and regularly inspecting the condition of \ntires.

When the system detects a \nmalfunction, the indicator flashes  for \napproximately one minute, then remains \ncontinuously lit. This sequence continues \nupon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long \nas the malfunction exists. When the TPMS \nmalfunction indicator is on, the system \nmight not be able to detect or signal \nunder-  or over- inflated  tires as intended.\nTPMS malfunctions can occur for a variety of reasons, \nincluding installing replacement or alternate tires or \nwheels that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. \nAlways check the TPMS malfunction indicator light after \nreplacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to \nensure that the replacement tires or wheels allow the \nTPMS to continue to function properly.\nNOTE:  If a tire has been replaced or repaired using a \ndifferent  tire sealant than the one available from Tesla, \nand a low tire pressure is detected, it is possible that the \ntire sensor has been damaged. Contact Tesla to have the \nfault repaired as soon as possible.\nSeasonal Tire Types\nUnderstand Your Tire Type\nThe type of tires that your vehicle is originally equipped \nwith depends on vehicle model and market region. It is \nimportant to understand the capabilities of your \nvehicle's tires and whether they are suited for summer, \nall-season, or winter driving. Check the information on \nthe sidewall of a tire for information about a tire's \nperformance characteristics (see Understanding Tire \nMarkings  on page 214 )\nSummer and All-Season Tires\nSummer tires and all season tires are designed for \nmaximum dry and wet road performance but are not \ndesigned to perform well in winter conditions. All-\nseason tires are designed to provide adequate traction \nin most conditions year-round, but may not provide the \nsame level of traction as winter tires in snowy or icy \nconditions. All-season tires can be identified  by \u201cALL \nSEASON\" and/or \"M+S\u201d (mud and snow) on the tire \nsidewall.\nIf driving in cold temperatures or on roads where snow \nor ice may be present, Tesla recommends using winter \ntires. If not equipped with winter tires, contact Tesla for \nwinter tire recommendations.\nWARNING:  In cold temperatures or on snow or ice, \nsummer and all-season tires do not provide \nadequate traction. Selecting and installing the \nappropriate tires for winter conditions is important \nto ensure the safety and optimum performance of \nyour Model 3 .\nWinter Tires\nUse winter tires to increase traction in snowy or icy \nconditions. When installing winter tires, always install a \ncomplete set of four tires at the same time. Winter tires \nmust be the same diameter, brand, construction and \ntread pattern on all four wheels. Contact Tesla for winter \ntire recommendations.\nWinter tires can be identified  by a \nmountain/snowflake  symbol on the tire's \nsidewall.\nWhen driving with winter tires, you may experience \nmore road noise, shorter tread life, and less traction on \ndry roads.\nNOTE:  Installing winter tires with aggressive compound \nand tread design may result in temporarily-reduced \nregenerative braking power. However, your vehicle is \ndesigned to recalibrate itself to restore regenerative \nbraking power after a short period of normal driving.\nNOTE:  If you install winter tires or replace your tires, \nreset the tire configuration  by navigating to Controls  > \nService  > Wheel & Tire Configuration  > Tires  (see Tire \nConfiguration  on page 180 ). This resets the learned tire \nsettings and improves the driving experience on your \nnew tires.\nDriving in Low Temperatures\nTire performance is reduced in low ambient \ntemperatures, resulting in reduced grip and an increased \nsusceptibility to damage from impacts. Performance \ntires (summer applications) have reduced traction in \nambient temperatures below 40\u00b0 F (5\u00b0 C) , and are not \nrecommended in snow/ice conditions. Performance tires \ncan temporarily harden when cold, causing you to hear \nrotational noise for the first few miles (kilometers)  until \nthe tires warm up.\nUsing Tire Chains\nTesla has tested and approved the following tire chains \n(also called snow chains) to increase traction in snowy \nconditions. Tire chains should only be installed on the \nrear tires. The approved tire chains can be purchased \nfrom Tesla.Tire Care and Maintenance\n181 Maintenance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03fe3261-f701-4057-a003-a4e18cdd2aec": {"__data__": {"id_": "03fe3261-f701-4057-a003-a4e18cdd2aec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e474d889-14a6-4b5f-88e8-ba4393ee3395", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "cf99988ad684e2d90ba2d27dda7e5a6ab5f46f01dfba4fb4b154ce4ac249db85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b317907d-7555-495f-aea6-15de386beae3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "d76401819b0b0775b58bbf370bb1165e6aae68bd00d167408887a68a905c663a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb1cfaf5-e1a6-456a-9b1b-3ea865d2d30c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "c420fad95637f005a330e97924974b473b907934445d5ad7b2446fb70c98215c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8045ef83a59fe9dee7a04cc3d3e9115b9bf237ec465f5909ead4f9bf244eab83", "text": "Tire Size Recommended Chain\n18\"/19\" K\u00f6nig CG-9 103\n20\" K\u00f6nig K-SUMMIT K34\nCAUTION:  If your Model 3  is equipped with aero \ncovers, you must remove them before installing \ntire chains  (see Removing and Installing Aero \nCovers  on page 178 ).

Do \nnot wait until Model 3  is due for a complete wash. If \nnecessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots \nand stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the \narea with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to \nremove the alcohol.\nKeep the exterior cameras free of dirt, condensation, or \nobstructions. These substances can cause unclear \npictures or Autopilot and safety features to stop \nworking (see #unique_294  on page ).\nFollow these steps when washing the exterior of Model \n3:\n1. Rinse Thoroughly\nBefore washing, flush  grime and grit from the vehicle \nusing a hose. Flush away accumulations of mud in \nareas where debris easily collects (such as wheel \nwells and panel seams). If salt has been used on the \nhighways (such as during winter months), thoroughly \nrinse all traces of road salt from the underside of the \nvehicle, wheel wells, and brakes.\n2. Hand Wash\nHand wash Model 3  using a clean soft cloth and cold \nor lukewarm water and a mild, high-quality car \nshampoo .\nCAUTION:  Some cleaners and car shampoos \ncontain chemicals that can cause damage or \ndiscoloration, especially to plastic trim pieces, \nlamps, or camera lenses. For example, some car \ncleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other \nhighly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can \ndamage exterior components. Do not use acidic \nproducts either. Damage or discoloration \nresulting from cleaning products is not covered \nby the warranty. \n3. Rinse with Clean Water\nAfter washing, rinse with clean water to prevent soap \nfrom drying on the surfaces.\n4. Dry Thoroughly and Clean Exterior Glass\nAfter washing and rinsing, dry thoroughly with a \nchamois. If necessary, dry the brakes by going on a \nshort drive and applying the brakes multiple times.Window Cleaning and Treatments\nClean windows and mirrors using an automotive glass \ncleaner.

Avoid aiming \nthe water jet directly at parking sensors  (if \nequipped) . Keep the nozzle moving and do not \nconcentrate the water jet on any one area.\nCAUTION:  Do not aim water hoses directly at \nwindows, door, or hood seals or at electronic \nmodules or exposed cabling.\nCAUTION:  To avoid corrosive damage that may \nnot be covered by the warranty, rinse away any \nroad salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel \nwells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry \nthe brakes by going on a short drive and applying \nthe brakes multiple times.\nCAUTION:  Avoid using tight-napped or rough \ncloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality \nmicrofiber  cleaning cloth is recommended.\nCAUTION:  If washing in an automatic car wash, use \ntouchless car washes only. These car washes have \nno parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of \nModel 3 . Some touchless car washes use caustic \nsolutions that, over time, can cause discoloration \nof decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to \nsoaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check \nthe product label or ask the staff at the car wash. \nDamage caused by improper washing is not \ncovered by the warranty.\nCAUTION:  If washing in an automatic car wash, \nmake sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid \nusing controls on the touchscreen that can result \nin accidentally opening doors or trunks while the \nvehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is \nnot covered by the warranty.\nCAUTION:  Ensure the wipers are off before \nwashing Model 3  to avoid the risk of damaging the \nwipers.\nCAUTION:  Do not use chemical based wheel \ncleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage \nthe finish  on the wheels.\nWARNING:  Never spray liquid at a high velocity \n(for example, if using a pressure washer) towards \nthe charge port while Model 3  is charging. Failure \nto follow these instructions can result in serious \ninjury or damage to the vehicle, charging \nequipment, or property.Cleaning the Interior\nFrequently inspect and clean the interior to maintain its \nappearance and to prevent premature wear. If possible, \nimmediately wipe up spills and remove marks. For \ngeneral cleaning, wipe interior surfaces using a soft cloth \n(such as microfiber)  dampened with a mixture of warm \nwater and mild non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners \non a concealed area before use). To avoid streaks, dry \nimmediately with a soft lint-free cloth.\nInterior Glass\nDo not scrape, or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on \nglass or mirrored surfaces. This can damage the \nreflective  surface of the mirror and the heating elements \nin the rear window.\nAirbags\nDo not allow any substance to enter an airbag cover. \nThis could affect  correct operation.\nDashboard and Plastic Surfaces\nDo not polish the upper surfaces of the dashboard. \nPolished surfaces are reflective  and could interfere with \nyour driving view.\nSeats\nWipe spills and chemical residues from interior surfaces \nas soon as possible using a soft cloth moistened with \nwarm water and non-detergent soap. Wipe gently in a \ncircular motion. Then wipe dry using a soft, lint-free \ncloth.\nAlthough seating surfaces are designed to repel stains, \nTesla recommends regular cleaning to maintain \nperformance and an as-new appearance. Promptly treat \ndye transfer from clothing, such as indigo-dyed denim. \nAvoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain \ncosmetics. Never use cleaners containing alcohol or \nbleach. Spot-test cleaners on an inconspicuous area \nbefore applying to visible surfaces.\nVacuum seats as needed to remove any loose dirt.\nCAUTION:  Aftermarket, non-Tesla seat covers may \ninhibit the sensitivity of a seat's occupancy sensors \nand may cause staining or damage.\nCarpets\nAvoid over-wetting carpets. For heavily soiled areas, use \na diluted upholstery cleaner.Cleaning\n184 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "836b71ad-8f99-434f-8b9e-ea3b80c93044": {"__data__": {"id_": "836b71ad-8f99-434f-8b9e-ea3b80c93044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66bb873c-36a9-4e36-ae72-f659c5401282", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "ff821160689fa9ec40e1c7f607407000b948d2d2d4c4cda20806e0929068eb5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52cd8333-9dfb-4c34-ac7b-8902c0828c66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "184", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "90d965103572ff43d72ce85b26454f2b07257e0f46fa566f545082cac7ceb8ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29ee0e5e-338c-44b6-ab5f-c14c095222b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "c7df1fcd7dc745998ddc62790fed778a0a8aafc9fcb44896e085ff61714993ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b308a8923ac61b13fbe775d22b9d37b674fcaafa73512fe6ecce23525dd9dcf9", "text": "Seat Belts\nExtend the belts to wipe.

Tesla recommends replacing \nthese filters  every 2 years (every year in China). Cabin \nfilters  can be purchased at the Tesla Shop .\nTo replace the cabin filters:\n1. Turn off the climate control system.\n2. Move the front passenger seat fully rearwards and \nremove the front passenger floor  mat.\n3. Use a clip pry tool to carefully release the push clips \nthat secure the front passenger footwell cover to the \ninstrument panel. Then, while supporting the footwell \ncover, disconnect the two electrical connectors and \nmove the footwell cover aside.\n\u25e6 For the light, carefully press down on the tab while \nreleasing the connector.\n\u25e6 For the speaker, carefully angle the vehicle-side \nconnector so that the small tab releases from the \nhole in the footwell cover-side connector while \nreleasing the connector.\nCAUTION:  To avoid damage, do not pull on the \nwires when disconnecting the connectors. \nWhen disconnecting the connectors, make sure \nto pull from the plastic on the connectors \nthemselves.\n4. Working from top-to-bottom, use a trim tool to \ncarefully release the right side panel from the center \nconsole.5. Remove the T20 screw that secures the cabin filter \ncover to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning \n(HVAC) module, then release the cabin filter  cover \nand move it aside. On some vehicles, the screw is a \nT20/6mm hybrid fastener. Locking tabs may also \nreplace the screw: use your index finger  and thumb \nto squeeze the two tabs at the bottom of the cabin \nfilter  cover. Tilt the cover outward to remove.\nNOTE:  If the HVAC module does not have a cabin \nfilter  cover, reinstall the trim panels and contact Tesla.\nWARNING:  Do not stretch, bend, or otherwise \ndamage the orange High Voltage (HV) cables \nthat are attached to the cabin filter  cover. If the \nHV cables are damaged, immediately \ndiscontinue this procedure. HV shock can result \nin serious injury or death.\n6. Fold the upper cabin filter\u2019s  tab upward and the \nlower filter\u2019s  tab downward.\n7. Holding the tab on the upper cabin filter,  pull the \nupper filter  out from the HVAC module.\n8. Holding the tab on the lower cabin filter,  pull the \nlower filter  upwards and then out from the HVAC \nmodule.\n9. Ensuring that the arrows on both new filters  face \ntowards the rear of the vehicle, insert the lower cabin \nfilter  into the HVAC module and lower it into place. \nThen, insert the upper cabin filter  above it.\n10. Fold the tabs inward so that the cabin filter  cover can \nbe installed.\n11. Install the cabin filter  cover by engaging the lower \ncover tab then securing the T20 screw or T20/6mm \nhybrid fastener. Tighten the screw to 1.2 Nm/0.89 ft-\nlbs. On vehicles with tabs instead of a T20 screw: \nmaneuver the top notch of the cabin filter  cover into \nplace, then secure the tabs at the bottom of the \nHVAC module.Parts and Accessories\n193 Maintenance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bbc1e01-b355-44a0-9967-c95bc3961ab0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bbc1e01-b355-44a0-9967-c95bc3961ab0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "194", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50d844bd-7cee-4806-a8f8-7637b53efaa3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "194", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "efe8e8cc2ed403c0a23c2e3fca81041993796553414248b3f03fd3274b10f72b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33ab578f-35e5-48a2-bc33-b8db29e5b23a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "62fa81d714658f61f1b04fce4688fdc15b39fb7166d963e53996e0057db202d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdbcc637-51ed-4cec-9fd2-d310c09ea4bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "195", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f1150350b7b19a3a23715cebbd1d6adffa0c5c1fd1f5e227ad9a72b629ff32a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d6f19fd408740f8d33e1186d4de18cc7a2774e11c27ccdd59c3027882a3d9077", "text": "12.

Refer to the RFID manufacturer's \ninstructions for specific  placement.\nNOTE:  You can also attach a weather-proof transponder \nto the front license plate.\nInstalling Front License Plate \nBracket\nTo accommodate jurisdictions that require a license \nplate on the front of your vehicle, Model 3  is equipped \nwith a license plate bracket. This bracket conforms to \nthe shape of your vehicle's front bumper and is adhered \nto it using strong adhesive.\nNOTE:  Tesla recommends performing this procedure on \na clean, dry vehicle during a warm day. Cold and/or wet \nconditions may result in reduced performance of the \nadhesive.\nTo install the front license plate bracket:\n1. Get isopropyl alcohol and test it on a non-visible \npainted surface of your vehicle to confirm  that it does \nnot damage or remove the paint.\n2. Clean the mounting site with isopropyl alcohol and \nallow to dry for at least one minute.\n3. Fully remove the protective tape from the adhesive at \nthe top of the bracket and partially remove the tape \nfrom the top of the adhesive on each side. Leave the \nbottom half of the tape on the sides in place and fold \nthe unattached tape outward for easy removal after \naligning the bracket to the bumper.\n4. While tilting the top of the license plate bracket away \nfrom the bumper (to prevent adhering it to the wrong \nlocation), align the bottom center of the license plate \nbracket with the middle of the grille as shown.\nNOTE:  Be as precise as possible when aligning the \nbracket because you will be unable to reposition it \nonce adhered to the bumper.\n5.

Tires that have \ndeep tread, and winter tires, are exempt from these marking requirements.\nWhere applicable, quality grades are found on the tire\u2019s sidewall between the tread shoulder and maximum section \nwidth. For example:\n\u2022 TREADWEAR 180\n\u2022 TRACTION AA\n\u2022 TEMPERATURE A\nThe quality grades are described next.\nNOTE:  In addition to the marking requirements, passenger car tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements.\nTreadwear\nThe treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled \nconditions on a specified  government test course.\nFor example, a tire graded 150 wears one and a half times better on a government test course than a tire graded 100. \nThe relative performance of tires depends on the actual conditions of their use, however, and can depart significantly \nfrom the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, road characteristics, and climate.\nTraction\nThe traction grades, from highest to lowest, are: AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent a tire\u2019s ability to stop on \nwet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C \nmight have poor traction performance.\nWARNING:  Defective tires are dangerous. Do not drive if a tire is damaged, excessively worn, or is inflated  to \nan incorrect pressure. The safety of the vehicle and occupants can be adversely affected.  Check tires regularly \nfor wear and to ensure there are no cuts, bulges or exposure of the ply/cord structure.\nWARNING:  The traction grade assigned to the tire is based on straight-ahead braking tests, and does not \ninclude: acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning or peak traction characteristics.\nTemperature\nThe temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire\u2019s resistance to the generation of heat and \nits ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified  indoor laboratory test wheel. \nSustained high temperature can cause the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead \nto sudden tire failure.\nThe grade C corresponds to the minimum level of performance that all passenger car tires must meet under the \nFederal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel \nthat exceed the minimum requirements.\nWARNING:  A tire\u2019s temperature grade is established for a tire that is properly inflated  and not overloaded. \nExcessive speed, under-inflation,  or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat \nbuildup and possible tire failure.Wheels and Tires\n216 MODEL 3 Owner's Manual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52c16d86-12e5-4bfd-8ef7-5566a12fac92": {"__data__": {"id_": "52c16d86-12e5-4bfd-8ef7-5566a12fac92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d770734b-160b-47b9-a7ff-46ef80a18520", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "635285b98658edf5967e4a73982b0f6a9747847286371e2f853967286bf23db8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b84e0377-78c5-4aee-a46a-544105a63465", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "6a80b8e5e65c8683b5b4031faa28ecfff2ac8dd394153fd981a9ebb54ffa3bac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a24dbb4c-c7c2-4731-b4cc-6dc1a29a3ed9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "model_3.pdf", "file_path": "data\\model_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9298433, "creation_date": "2023-12-09", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-09", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-15"}, "hash": "f4ed4c2b48266e1b92eeadf838ec89942b327fb21c9675c9a36241f2715105a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "00df79be4a9cc762887531ea4940728bda89308f55bb3517c483aa2dcffac953", "text": "Tire and Loading Glossaries\nGeneral Wheel and Tire Terms\nAccessory Weight The combined weight (in excess of those items replaced) of items available as factory \ninstalled equipment.\nBead The inner edge of a tire that is shaped to fit to the rim and form an air tight seal.

Always transport Model 3  with all four tires \noff the ground. Ensure that the tires are unable to spin at \nany time during transport.\nWARNING:  NEVER TRANSPORT YOUR VEHICLE \nWITH THE TIRES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY \nCAN SPIN. DOING SO CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT \nDAMAGE AND OVERHEATING. IN RARE CASES \nEXTREME OVERHEATING MAY CAUSE THE \nSURROUNDING COMPONENTS TO IGNITE.\nDo not transport Model 3  using any method that is not \nspecified  by Tesla. Adhere to the instructions provided in \nthe following sections and observe all warnings and \ncautions provided. Damage caused by improper \ntransporting of your vehicle is not covered by the \nwarranty.\nNOTE:  Tesla is not liable or responsible for reimbursing \nservices not dispatched through Tesla Roadside \nAssistance.\nApproved Methods for Transporting\nA flatbed  truck or comparable transport vehicle is the \nrecommended method of transporting Model 3 . The \nvehicle can face either direction when using a flatbed.\nIf Model 3  must be transported without a flatbed  truck, \nthen wheel lifts and dollies must be used to ensure that \nall four wheels are off of the ground. This method may \nonly be used for a maximum of 35 miles (55 km) , and \nmust not exceed the manufacturer speed rating of the dollies. With this method, Tesla recommends the vehicle \nfacing forward so that the front wheels are lifted and the \nrear wheels are on dollies.\nCAUTION:  Enable Transport Mode (see Activate \nTransport Mode  on page 221 ) before winching Model \n3 onto a flatbed  truck (see Pull onto the Flatbed \nTruck  on page 222 ). If Transport Mode is not \navailable or the touchscreen is not accessible, self-\nloading dollies or tire skates must be used to load \nthe vehicle into the approved transportation \nposition. Tesla is not responsible for any damage \ncaused by or during the transport of Model 3 , \nincluding personal property damage or damage \ncaused by using self-loading dollies or tire skates.\nNOTE:  Transport Mode is only intended to allow for \nwinching Model 3  onto a flatbed  truck or repositioning \nthe vehicle out of a parking space. While in Transport \nMode, the tires are allowed to rotate slowly (under 3 \nmph or 5 km/h ) and for a very short distance (less than \n30 feet or 10 meters ). See Activate Transport Mode  on \npage 221 . Exceeding these boundaries can lead to \nsignificant  damage and overheating that is not covered \nby the warranty.\nWARNING:  Model 3  is equipped with high voltage \ncomponents that may be compromised as a result \nof a collision  (see High Voltage Components  on \npage 160 ). Before transporting Model 3 , it is \nimportant to assume these components are \nenergized. Always follow high voltage safety \nprecautions (wearing personal protection \nequipment, etc.) until emergency response \nprofessionals have evaluated the vehicle and can \naccurately confirm  that all high voltage systems \nare no longer energized. Failure to do so may \nresult in serious injury. \nActivate Transport Mode\nTransport Mode keeps the parking brake disengaged \nwhile winching Model 3  onto a flatbed  truck. When \nactive, Transport Mode displays a message indicating \nthat the vehicle will remain free-rolling. To enable \nTransport Mode:\n\u2022 Low voltage  power is required. You will be unable to \nuse the touchscreen to activate Transport Mode if \nModel 3  has no power.\n\u2022 Model 3  must detect a key. Transport Mode is \navailable only when a key is detected.\nTo activate Transport Mode:\n1.

Try charging the vehicle using different  external charging equipment (including charge \ncable, charging station, or charging stall).\n\u2022 If the vehicle begins charging, the issue was likely with the equipment.\n\u2022 If the vehicle still does not charge, the issue may be with the vehicle.\nIf this alert appears while a charge cable is not connected or if the issue is suspected to be with the vehicle, inspect \nthe charge port inlet and the charge cable connector for any obstructions, such as debris, moisture, and/or foreign \nobjects. Make sure any charge port inlet obstruction has been removed and any moisture has been allowed to dry, \nthen try re-inserting the cable into the charge port.\nYou can also try charging your vehicle using a Tesla Supercharger or Destination Charging location, all of which can \nbe located through the map on your vehicle's touchscreen display.

This brake assist function activates temporarily to make sure you have full \nbraking capability in conditions where reduced braking performance is detected by your vehicle.\nWhen this assist function activates, you may feel the brake pedal pull away from your foot and notice a strong \nincrease in brake pressure. You may also hear a pumping sound coming from the brake hydraulic unit at the front of \nthe vehicle. This will usually last for a few seconds, depending on road surface and vehicle speed. This is completely \nnormal and does not indicate any issue with your vehicle.\nWhat to do:\nContinue to press the brake pedal as you normally would, and do not \"pump\" (repeatedly press and release) the \npedal as this will interrupt the function.\nThis alert will clear when your vehicle comes to a stop or you are no longer pressing the brake pedal. It may still be \ndisplayed for up to 5 seconds afterward.\nReduced braking performance is usually temporary, and can occur for a number of reasons including high brake \ntemperatures after heavy brake use, or driving in extremely cold or wet conditions. It can also indicate that your \nbrake pads or rotors have worn to the point that normal replacement is needed.\nIf you continue to experience reduced braking performance which does not improve over time, please contact Tesla \nservice at your convenience for a brake inspection.\nFor more information, see Hydraulic Fade Compensation  on page 72 .\nPCS_a016\nCannot charge - Poor grid power quality possible\nRetry / Try other charge location or Supercharging\nWhat this alert means:\nCharging has stopped due to a condition that prevents your vehicle from charging with AC power.

The \nEDR is designed to record data related to vehicle \ndynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, \ntypically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in Model 3  is \ndesigned to record data such as:\n\u2022 How various systems in your vehicle were operating;\n\u2022 Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts \nwere buckled/fastened;\n\u2022 How far (if at all) the driver was pressing the \naccelerator and/or brake pedal; and,\n\u2022 How fast the vehicle was traveling.\nThe data can help provide a better understanding of the \ncircumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.\nNOTE:  EDR data is recorded by your vehicle only if a \nnon-trivial crash situation occurs; no data is recorded by \nthe EDR under normal driving conditions and no \npersonal data (for example, name, gender, age, and \ncrash location) is recorded. However, other parties, such \nas law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with \nperson identifying data they routinely acquire during a \ncrash investigation.\nTo read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is \nrequired, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. \nIn addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, \nsuch as law enforcement, that have this special \nequipment, can read the information if they have access \nto the vehicle or the EDR. Tesla may also access the EDR \nremotely in some crash circumstances.\nVehicle Telematics\nModel 3  is equipped with electronic modules that \nmonitor and record data from various vehicle systems, \nincluding the motor, Autopilot components, Battery, \nbraking and electrical systems. The electronic modules \nrecord information about various driving and vehicle \nconditions, including braking, acceleration, trip and \nother related information regarding your vehicle. These \nmodules also record information about the vehicle\u2019s \nfeatures such as charging events and status, the \nenabling/disabling of various systems, diagnostic \ntrouble codes, VIN, speed, direction and location.\nThe data is stored by the vehicle and may be accessed, \nused and stored by Tesla service technicians during \nvehicle servicing or periodically transmitted to Tesla \nwirelessly through the vehicle\u2019s telematics system. This \ndata may be used by Tesla for various purposes, \nincluding, but not limited to: providing you with Tesla \ntelematics services; troubleshooting; evaluation of your \nvehicle\u2019s quality, functionality and performance; analysis and research by Tesla and its partners for the \nimprovement and design of our vehicles and systems; to \ndefend Tesla; and as otherwise may be required by law. \nIn servicing your vehicle, Tesla can potentially resolve \nissues remotely simply by reviewing your vehicle\u2019s data \nlog.\nTesla\u2019s telematics system wirelessly transmits vehicle \ninformation to Tesla on a periodic basis. The data is used \nas previously described and helps ensure the proper \nmaintenance of your vehicle.
